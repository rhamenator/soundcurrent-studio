# Localization

EQ and Studio share the same Qt translation/runtime interface. It is reusable by the DAW without coupling the DSP to Qt. Copperfin was inspected read-only: its deterministic fallback, pseudo localization, placeholder checks and separation of machine contracts inform this design. No Copperfin or DAW files were modified.

## Current coverage

English is the source language. **All 33 non-English catalogs, including Nynorsk, are populated for the 822 currently extracted source messages. No language pack is native-reviewed.** This is catalog coverage, not proof that every user-facing message has been extracted. The requested second pass has expanded the catalogs to include additional interface and installer messages. Whole-interface coverage remains unproven; candidate audits and runtime checks have limited, documented scopes. Populated translations remain unverified; missing messages fall back to English. `data/localization/catalogs.json` records exact counts and review status. Contextual AI review, native-speaker verification, compiled runtime checks and visual/package qualification are separate evidence categories.

Coverage is global: European languages, Arabic, Hebrew, Persian, simplified/traditional Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Hindi, Indonesian, Vietnamese, Thai and Swahili. Portuguese for Portugal and Brazil and the two Chinese scripts are separate catalogs. Regional fallback reuses a base-language catalog only where one is explicitly available; explicit script variants are not collapsed into another script. Qt locale data maps region-only Chinese tags (zh-TW/zh-CN) to the corresponding available script catalog and accepts equivalent explicit Latin-script Portuguese tags. Without a Portuguese region, Qt’s default territory selects the regional pack; unsupported explicit regions fall back to English. Unicode/private-use formatting extensions do not block language selection. The prior 143-item Europe inventory is retained as **planned** work in `language-inventory.json`, including minority languages. The inventory is extensible and is not a claim of full global coverage.

The number/date locale selector independently exposes the locales supplied by the installed Qt version (hundreds of language/region/script combinations). Having a formatting locale does **not** mean that the UI is translated into its language. Qt 6.4 and Qt 6.12 may provide different inventories.

## Use

Open **Settings & calibration → Language and regional settings**. Choose the interface language and number/date format independently. Use **Quit** and reopen to apply changes; closing the window leaves the process running. This avoids rebuilding views while live audio is active. Unsupported languages or missing messages use English. Native OS file dialogs may continue using the operating system's language.

Selection precedence: `--language TAG`, saved app preference, `SOUNDCURRENT_LANGUAGE` when the preference is system, then system UI-language preferences, then English. Example:

```sh
soundcurrent-eq --language fr-CA
soundcurrent-studio --language pt-BR
```

Language selection uses embedded resources; it never downloads catalogs or executes translation files. Settings persist stable language tags. Preset IDs, model/brand names, custom names, schema keys, routing IDs, frequency limits, units and JSON numbers stay invariant. Built-in preset display names can be translated while their item data retains the original ID. Qt numeric controls parse the selected number locale; JSON/DSP use numeric values. RTL layouts do not reverse the frequency band order or change channel mappings.

## Translators and maintenance

Edit `data/localization/soundcurrent_TAG.ts` with Qt Linguist. The shared context is `SoundCurrent`; user-facing literals use `SC_TR(...)`, or `soundcurrent::i18n::text(...)` at a data-driven view boundary. Keep `%1`, `%2`, `%n` and `%L1` placeholders intact. Use full sentences with placeholders instead of concatenated translated fragments. Current UI messages are not numerus messages. The maintenance script rejects numerus entries before rewriting any catalog, until explicit Qt language-specific plural rules and regression tests are implemented. Unfinished translated text and translator comments are preserved during updates.

```sh
python3 scripts/localization.py --update
python3 scripts/localization.py --check
```

Updating requires Qt Linguist `lrelease` (Qt 6 preferred). Compiled QM files are committed with SHA-256 provenance in `catalogs.json` and embedded in every Linux/Windows build; ordinary builds need only Qt Core/Widgets. The audit requires only Python and checks extraction freshness, blanks, duplicate keys, placeholders, literal ampersands, rich-text link/tag integrity, file-dialog extension patterns, embedded resource inventory, coverage and TS/QM hashes. `--require-complete` rejects any unfinished translation across all languages. `requiredCompleteLocales` in the seed inventory prevents already-populated languages from silently acquiring blanks when UI text changes. Add a locale and its native name to `seed-translations.json` before the first update; subsequent updates preserve existing translator edits. Standard Qt action captions use the embedded application catalog; OS-native dialogs may retain the operating system language. Use proper language/script/region tags; do not copy a regional label to imply a reviewed regional translation.

Developer-only test languages `qps-ploc` and `qps-rtl` expand text and exercise RTL layout. `--localization-ui-test --language TAG` constructs the real views without starting audio/network processing. `--ui-self-test` remains deterministic English regardless of the user's preferences.

Before qualifying a language: translate **all** messages, obtain native-speaker review of audio terminology and regional usage, check dialogs/accessibility/mnemonics, decimal input, Unicode paths, RTL channel/frequency ordering, 1280×720 and HiDPI layouts on both Linux and Windows. Installer text and native driver/vendor interfaces are separate translation work; 1.1.0 installers remain English. The native driver and system routing contracts stay unchanged.

## Translation accuracy

See [translation review](translation-review.md) for contextual corrections, known uncertainties and fluent-review requirements. Audio terminology notes in `data/localization/translation-context.json` are embedded in Qt Linguist catalogs. Structural audits do not certify linguistic accuracy.

Locale inference uses [Qt QLocale language, script and territory data](https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/qlocale.html), rather than treating every four-character suffix as a script.

### Studio channel-name provenance

Studio schema 1 retains each channel's existing `name` string. New generated
names additionally save `nameProvenance: {"version": 1, "role": "left"}`.
The role IDs are `channel`, `mono`, `left`, `right`, `front-left`, `front-right`,
`center`, `lfe`, `rear-left`, `rear-right`, `side-left`, and `side-right`.
They are stable metadata, never translated. The generic channel role uses its
zero-based channel position only to derive the canonical one-based name.

A profile without provenance keeps its names as user-owned text, even when a
name matches a built-in English label. Unsupported versions/roles are retained
verbatim but never interpreted. Known metadata is usable only when the saved
name still matches that role's canonical name; stale metadata cannot override
a custom name. Explicit name editing clears the metadata. Resizing and undo
preserve it; an unchanged name field preserves it too.

Generated names now use translated role captions in the channel dropdown, name
editor, route labels and meters. Generic channel indices use the selected number
locale. Center channel has a separate translation key from neutral balance
Center; LFE stays the standard abbreviation. Display text never replaces the
canonical persisted name or role ID. Legacy/custom names remain verbatim.

### Windows audio helper language

The app passes the catalog it actually loaded as a separate `-Language`
argument to cable/native audio setup. This follows a command-line language
override without changing persisted language preferences. The shared argument
builder retains the script path, requester ID, quiet mode and existing action.
Standalone shortcuts may omit the argument and use saved preference/system UI
culture through the helper lookup. Unsupported helper catalog tags fall back
to English; the development pseudo-locales are not exported as helper packs.

Helper translation source keys are compared ordinally and case-sensitively.
Unknown external text, including different capitalization, is kept verbatim.
The common dialog title is localized; most helper message bodies and NSIS
pages still need translation and actual Windows package qualification.

### Audio helper output encoding

Cable and native setup scripts set console output and native-pipeline encoding
to UTF-8 without a BOM. The app accumulates QProcess output chunks and decodes
the finished buffer as UTF-8, retaining the existing whitespace trimming.
This protocol is independent of the Windows ANSI code page and number locale.

An inert ASCII-source PowerShell fixture emits a UTF-8 payload containing
French, Japanese, Arabic and a literal placeholder. A compiled Qt test captures
that child process output and checks the exact decoded value. Windows package
builds run it explicitly with powershell.exe and a process-only RemoteSigned
policy; no machine execution policy, audio endpoints or driver state is changed.
Host PowerShell qualification does not prove Windows PowerShell 5.1 behavior.

### Owned setup template formatting

Use Format-SCSetupText with a literal owned Source and a separate Values array. It supports numbered %1 through %99, including repeated tokens and reordered translations. Values are inserted once as literal data. A translated token mismatch falls back to the source template; missing values or unsupported %L/numerus placeholders reject the template. Do not pass arbitrary caught external diagnostics as owned templates. Production lookup sources must be declared in setup-sources.json and pass the AST inventory check.

### Setup prose regression guard

The PowerShell AST candidate audit covers raw English-like literals anywhere in the two shipped cable/native helpers, including returned fragments, interpolation and dialog captions. Declared Get/Format-SCSetupText source arguments are excluded. setup-prose-backlog.json distinguishes invariant product names from untranslated candidates. New candidates fail the inert setup test; removing translated candidates is allowed. Ordinary checks never regenerate the backlog. The backlog is unfinished work, not a coverage exemption proving completion.

The heuristic does not establish full interface extraction, does not parse NSIS, and does not interpret external variable-only diagnostics. Use the separate GUI/backend audits as well.

### External installer labels

EXTERNAL_UI_LABELS in the catalog validator is scoped to reviewed instruction source keys. It preserves the exact bundled third-party button label and its occurrence count. Do not freeze SoundCurrent-owned captions globally. The cable repair instruction preserves Install Driver and inserts the separately translated Audio driver setup caption through a numbered value. Native linguistic verification and actual Windows installer qualification remain separate requirements.

### Installer source audit

nsis_string_audit.py inventories supported custom controls, MessageBox/DetailPrint text, section captions, MUI headers and text definitions. nsis-text-backlog.json is an explicit unfinished-work inventory; new raw text or unaudited language references fail catalog unit tests. It is not a complete NSIS parser and does not expand macros or line continuations. A $(key) reference does not prove its definition, translation, layout or installed runtime behavior. Compiler and install/update/uninstall checks remain separate gates.

The source-specific external-label rule also preserves CABLE Input and CABLE Output in the reviewed Windows endpoint diagnostic. These are default external device labels; user-edited names and SoundCurrent-owned action captions remain separate.

### Windows PowerShell 5.1 qualification

The 2026-10-08 inert helper run passed on Windows PowerShell 5.1.26100.9549: 1,122 required source/catalog lookups per application, isolated message fixtures and real quiet no-action errors in French, Arabic and Nynorsk. See second-pass-windows-ps51.json and its runtime log. The initial policy-blocked invocation is retained; the retry used process-only RemoteSigned. This does not qualify current installed Qt UI, driver operations or installer lifecycle. Native-speaker verification remains unverified.

The repair-failure instruction now uses a translated Audio driver setup caption through %1, with source-specific protection for Remove Driver, CABLE Input and CABLE Output. Host checks cover all 34 catalogs and reject altered labels and placeholders. One longer cable repair notice remains untranslated. Earlier Windows PowerShell qualification applies to its recorded source commit; it does not qualify this new instruction. See second-pass-cable-repair-failure.json.

### Helper source inventory and extraction

Catalog extraction includes setup-sources.json directly; a seed entry is no longer required merely to retain a declared helper source. Adding a declaration invalidates existing catalogs until they are updated and translated. Declarations must be a list of unique, nonempty strings. This is separate from the PowerShell AST gate that checks literal calls against declarations, and does not prove complete extraction of unmarked interface text. Tests and scope are recorded in second-pass-setup-source-inventory.json.

### Direct installer language definitions

Reviewed $(key) references now require one nonempty direct LangString definition for each declared MUI language in that installer file. Missing languages and duplicate definitions fail the gate. This limited check does not expand includes or macros and normalizes MUI names to LANG tokens; language aliases need explicit support before use. It does not establish translation accuracy, compiler success, layout or whole-interface coverage. Existing English installer text remains pending translation. See second-pass-nsis-language-definitions.json.

### Installer audio page heading

Connect your audio is translated in all 33 non-English catalogs. Both installer variants reference SCConnectAudio with a direct English definition. Tests keep this source synchronized with finished catalog entries. Minimal fixtures using the actual definition and header lines compile in NSIS; full current installer builds and installed UI qualification remain pending. Only English is currently enabled in the installers. Translated heading entries alone do not provide localized installer pages or language selection. See second-pass-installer-audio-heading.json.

The audio page subtitle uses the shared catalog template Set up %1 for %2., translated across all 33 non-English locales. Driver and application product names remain exact; ordering follows each translation. Both installer variants reference SCSetupAudio with direct English definitions. Rendering/placeholder tests and minimal NSIS compiler fixtures passed. These templates are prepared for future installer locale activation; current installers still enable only English. Full current package and UI qualification remain pending. See second-pass-installer-setup-subtitle.json.

The cable and native driver checkbox captions are translated across all 33 non-English catalogs, with exact driver-name guards. Cable installation retains its absence condition and administrator approval wording; the native option retains shared install/update semantics. Both installer variants reference SCInstallDriver with their respective direct English definitions. Actual definition/control lines compile in minimal NSIS fixtures, and all catalog/name-guard tests pass. Installers still enable only English; full locale activation, translated page layout and current package lifecycle are pending. See second-pass-installer-driver-checkbox.json.

### Shared installer caption export

windows_installer_catalogs.py exports the reviewed heading, setup subtitle and driver checkbox for every catalog locale and both routes. Use --product with SoundCurrent EQ or SoundCurrent Studio and --output with a destination JSON file. Captions and NSIS-escaped values are separate fields. Name substitution is single-pass; unsupported placeholder forms and control characters fail. Export requires finished, validated catalogs before writing. All 204 captions compile in a syntax-only fixture using the English language ID; this is not locale activation, layout or package qualification. Production packaging integration is described below; remaining text and language selection are pending. See second-pass-installer-caption-export.json.

### Installer build integration

The Windows build script now invokes windows_installer_catalogs.py to produce installer-translations.json and a separate localized-installer.nsi under build-windows-native, then compiles that generated file. The generator validates product/schema, preserves source files and rejects missing/duplicate caption definitions or unplanned language activation. Current English build copies match source bytes for all four installer variants. Host PowerShell parsing and CLI generation passed; full Windows packaging execution, language selection and installed UI/lifecycle qualification remain pending. See second-pass-installer-build-integration.json.

Installer driver-check failure guidance is translated across all 33 non-English locales. It inserts the translated Audio driver setup caption and retains the app/Start-menu retry paths. Both installer variants reference SCDriverCheckFailed; production caption generation includes it. Catalog tests, generated-English source preservation and a 272-caption syntax fixture passed. The fixture uses English language IDs and does not test locale selection or layout. Current full installer builds, locale activation and UI/lifecycle qualification remain pending. See second-pass-installer-driver-check.json.

The cable installer restart notice is translated across all 33 non-English catalogs and exported only for the cable route. It preserves the requirement to restart Windows before using the equalizer or opening cable settings, with exact VB-CABLE name guards. Generated-English preservation tests and a 306-caption syntax-only fixture passed. Language activation, layout, full current packages and installed lifecycle tests remain pending. See second-pass-installer-reboot.json.

The native installer shared-driver notice now asks users to quit any running SoundCurrent app rather than assuming both products are running. All 33 non-English catalogs retain the conditional driver-retention advice when removing one app. Export is native-only; driver ownership/uninstall behavior is unchanged. Catalog tests, source-preserving build generation and a 340-caption syntax fixture passed. Current installer language activation, real UI layout and package lifecycle remain pending. See second-pass-installer-shared-driver.json.

The native installer administrator-approval notice is translated across all 33 non-English catalogs. Context review identifies the driver manager as a signed program and retains the conditional restart advice; several software-role translations were refined. Native-only export and generated-source preservation tests passed, along with a 374-caption syntax-only fixture. No elevation behavior, real locale selection, installed layout or current package lifecycle is qualified by these checks. See second-pass-installer-native-approval.json.

The native existing-driver notice now makes app registration conditional on keeping driver setup enabled, matching the installer’s checkbox-gated manager invocation. All 33 non-English catalogs retain that condition, driver availability for the other app and exact product names. Defaults and ownership behavior are unchanged. Catalog tests, generated-source preservation and a 408-caption syntax fixture passed. Real registration, language activation, layout and current package lifecycle remain unqualified. See second-pass-installer-native-present.json.

The native installer routing explanation is translated across all 33 non-English catalogs. It distinguishes playback through the app, physical speaker/headphone selection inside the app and preserved hardware drivers. Name guards, native-only export, source-preserving generation and a 442-caption syntax fixture passed. This does not qualify real routing, language selection, layout or current package lifecycle. See second-pass-installer-native-routing.json.

### Windows metadata encoding failure

Studio Windows CI run 37861227271 failed while reading UTF-8 catalog metadata as CP1252. Both shared exporter copies now read setup source and catalog metadata explicitly as UTF-8. Multilingual test fixture and runner JSON I/O is explicit too. A simulated-CP1252 regression reproduces the legacy failure before output and verifies the fixed exporter across all 34 locales with exact Arabic caption preservation. Fresh Windows CI and current package qualification remain pending. The EQ Windows job also failed, but its detailed log was unavailable; the matching cause is not independently confirmed. See second-pass-windows-codepage.json.

Installer build-copy generation now uses UTF-8 byte I/O and preserves each matched definition’s carriage return. A retained failure demonstrates the prior CRLF-to-LF conversion. Current-English fixtures preserve LF, CRLF and mixed endings byte-for-byte across all four installer variants, independent of host text-mode defaults. This host regression does not qualify a Windows build or installed package. See second-pass-installer-source-endings.json.

Studio Windows CI run 37861749452 passed catalog export, then failed the Qt/PowerShell output fixture without useful detail. The inert fixture now reports bounded stdout/stderr hexadecimal bytes and process status, and returns explicit errors. Host success, failed-start and nonzero-child cases pass. No production audio code changed, and the Windows failure’s root cause remains unresolved pending fresh CI evidence. See second-pass-process-output-diagnostics.json.

The Windows output fixture previously ran from the build directory before Qt/CRT deployment, while the verified SDK installer did not set Qt bin on PATH. It now runs from the package stage after app-local dependencies are deployed, reports numeric exit codes and is removed on success before packaging. Both build scripts parse on the host. Dependency ordering is a plausible cause of the silent Windows failure, but the exact loader exit code and successful Windows rerun remain unverified. See second-pass-staged-output-fixture.json.

The existing-cable notice now uses the actual translated Quit app button label; a missing Quit key was rejected during initial validation. All 33 non-English catalogs retain reuse and output-restoration guidance, with several off-state descriptions clarified. Source/name/placeholder checks and a 476-caption syntax fixture passed. Separately, Studio Windows run 37862439944 passed the staged output fixture and reached UI tests, then failed the German owned-validation check. This Windows evidence applies to its recorded commit, not the new caption batch. Remaining activation, layout and package lifecycle gates remain incomplete.

### Incomplete cable driver repair notice

The installer repair notice now has catalog translations in all 33 non-English locales. Review preserves the remove/restart/reinstall/restart sequence and protects VB-CABLE. Catalog tests and all 510 exported NSIS caption literals pass; the compiler fixture uses English language IDs and does not prove language activation or installed layout. Native-speaker review remains unverified. See `tests/results/localization/second-pass-installer-cable-repair.json`.

### Signed cable installer instructions

All 33 non-English catalogs now contain the signed-installer notice. The exact external button caption `Install Driver` and the required Windows restart remain intact. Catalog tests and 544 exported caption literals pass syntax checks. This does not qualify installer locale activation, translated layout, or a current installed package. Native-speaker verification is unverified. See `tests/results/localization/second-pass-installer-signed-notice.json`.

### Windows Studio route validation qualification

Windows CI run 37863575451 passed for Studio commit `6a26206`, including 35 localized UI assertions and installer compilation. It predates the newer repair and signed-installer notices and does not test installed-package lifecycle. Test diagnostic logs now preserve exact Unicode as UTF-8 hex; actual dialog assertions remain unchanged. EQ now uses the same relevant PR Windows-check trigger as Studio. See `tests/results/localization/second-pass-windows-route-success.json`.

### Shared cable ownership notice

All 33 non-English catalogs now contain the shared-cable notice. The English caption explicitly identifies the last SoundCurrent app, and contextual review checked optional removal, other software dependencies, extra A/B virtual cables, and quitting background processing. Catalog tests and 578 exported caption literals compile. Native-speaker review, installer language activation, installed layout and current package lifecycle remain unverified. See `tests/results/localization/second-pass-installer-shared-cable.json`.

### Cable routing caption and Windows Unicode dialog evidence

All custom audio-page control captions now use catalog-backed LangStrings, with all 33 non-English translations prepared. A new guard rejects raw control captions. Other welcome, progress and error text remains incomplete; installer locale activation is pending. All 612 exported caption literals compile in an English-ID syntax fixture. Studio Windows run 37864139375 passed at commit `dde32e7`; six actual dialog captures decode as strict UTF-8, including French “Redémarrez”. That run predates the shared/routing caption work and does not verify installed-package lifecycle. See `second-pass-installer-cable-routing.json` and `second-pass-windows-dialog-utf8.json` under `tests/results/localization/`.

### Quit before update and uninstall dialogs

Both installer routes now use catalog translations for the quit-before-update and quit-before-uninstall messages in all 33 non-English locales. Review preserves full process exit, closing-window/background behavior and updates without prior uninstall. A shared single-value formatter rejects malformed placeholders and preserves inserted names literally; existing retry and Quit app captions now use it too. Catalog tests, final exporter tests and 748 caption syntax checks pass. Installer locale activation and installed-package lifecycle qualification remain pending. See `tests/results/localization/second-pass-installer-quit-dialogs.json`.

### Installer progress and retry captions

Three shared catalog sources now translate native driver setup progress, cable installer launch, and retry progress across all 33 non-English locales. Review preserves route names, shared ownership and failure/restart distinctions. All static DetailPrint caption sites use LangStrings; dynamic helper output is preserved. Catalog tests and 884 exported caption literals pass syntax checks. Installer locale activation, current installed UI and package lifecycle remain pending. See `tests/results/localization/second-pass-installer-progress.json`.

### Native driver removal error

The removal failure notice now asks users to quit any running SoundCurrent app, instead of both EQ and Studio unconditionally. All 33 non-English translations are prepared and contextually reviewed; native-speaker review remains unverified. The uninstall failure still aborts before payload deletion and keeps the app for retry. Catalog tests and 918 caption syntax checks pass; native installed-package runtime and locale activation remain unqualified. See `tests/results/localization/second-pass-installer-native-removal.json`.

### Cable removal failure and helper details

The owned cable-removal explanation now has translations in all 33 non-English locales. The caller retains the newline and `$1` helper-output suffix, and the failure still aborts uninstall so users can retry. The NSIS audit accepts only the reviewed suffix after a real LangString; extra prose/variables and missing definitions reject. Catalog tests, 952 caption literals and 34 composite message syntax checks pass. This does not qualify installed-uninstaller behavior or locale activation. See `tests/results/localization/second-pass-installer-cable-removal.json`.

### Restart-dialog reuse and rebuilt Linux UI checks

The installer restart dialog now reuses the existing all-locale restart notice. Exit-code handling, reboot flag and silent default are preserved. Both Linux apps were rebuilt with current catalogs: EQ passed 40 selected checks and Studio passed 43, including all 33 non-English UI locales, two layout-test locales, regional-format and UTF-8 diagnostics. These are offscreen widget assertions, not installed desktop or package lifecycle qualification. The restart reference audit and 34 translated message syntax checks also pass. See `tests/results/localization/second-pass-restart-reuse-linux-ui.json`.

### Setup failure after app installation

The shared dialog now reports setup failure without falsely claiming an existing native driver is absent. All 33 non-English translations preserve the installed app, Start-menu retry and details for the reason. A single-pass formatter validates three distinct parameters. The dialog quotes the actual currently English shortcut name `Audio driver setup`; shortcut localization and migration cleanup remain a known interface gap. All supported NSIS MessageBox sites now reference declared LangStrings. Catalog tests, 1020 caption literals and 68 setup-failure message syntax checks pass. These do not qualify locale activation or installed-package lifecycle. See `tests/results/localization/second-pass-installer-setup-failure.json`.

### Installer welcome paragraphs

Both welcome paragraphs now have translations in all 33 non-English locales. Review preserves update without prior uninstall, retained settings/presets/equipment profiles, saving work and full exit/background behavior. Generic quit wording avoids an incorrect button caption. Arabic grammar, Romanian wording and Swahili preset terminology were refined. Two catalog sources are joined with an escaped CRLF paragraph break after app-name substitution. Catalog tests and 1088 caption literals, including 68 welcome texts, compile with the actual MUI welcome macro. All supported non-Section NSIS text sites now reference LangStrings; whole-interface coverage, language activation, shortcut names and installed layout/lifecycle remain unqualified. See `tests/results/localization/second-pass-installer-welcome.json`.

### Repair-helper notice second pass

The long pre-repair modal is translated in all 33 non-English locales. Its app action uses the localized Audio driver setup caption; external endpoint and installer labels remain exact. The actual modal expression passed inert argument capture in all 34 catalogs, and 1,190 helper lookups plus safe fault and mutation checks passed. No driver actions or VM session were used. This is formatting evidence, not installed dialog layout or native-language qualification. See `tests/results/localization/second-pass-helper-repair.json`.

### Explicit installer locale identities

`installer-language-map.json` covers all 34 catalog tags with unique NSIS names and Windows language IDs. Validation checks catalog coverage, duplicate identities, RTL direction, and actual installed NLF/MUI asset pairs. On the Linux NSIS installation, 33 pairs match; Swahili has no built-in pair and requires owned installer translations. The mapping is validated during caption export and has a CTest regression gate. Installer locale activation remains incomplete; this mapping does not enable language selection or qualify rendered installer pages.

### Swahili installer assets

Owned `packaging/windows/languages/Swahili.nlf` and `Swahili.nsh` provide 89 base strings and 62 Modern UI declarations, including both conditional component-description variants. Altered NSIS source provenance and its zlib notice are retained alongside review inventories. Token, quote and whitespace checks passed; Unicode base and full MUI install/uninstall fixtures compiled for both component-page variants. Fixtures were never executed. The locale-map validator resolves the missing built-in Swahili pair to these owned files and checks their Windows ID and direction. Native-speaker verification, rendered UI qualification, and installer language-selection activation remain incomplete. See `tests/results/localization/swahili-installer-assets.json`.

### Installer language activation in generated builds

Windows package builds now request `--activate-languages`. The generator inserts all 34 mapped MUI languages and all owned captions, using the owned Swahili assets. It adds the per-user language-selection registry configuration and uninstall restoration, maps numeric IDs to catalog tags, forwards tags to every owned setup helper invocation/shortcut, and sets the custom audio page RTL direction. English-only source templates and the default generation mode remain auditable. Both actual generated route templates compiled with inert fixture payloads, and catalog maintenance tests passed. This proves generation and compiler compatibility, not installed runtime behavior: first-run app handoff, English shortcut display names, language-selection persistence, long-caption layout, RTL rendering, and install/update/uninstall qualification remain open. See `tests/results/localization/installer-language-activation.json`.

### Installer preference as the initial app default

On Windows, the app reads the per-user product `InstallerLocale` only while its `i18n/language` key is absent. Exact catalog identities are accepted; invalid, pseudo, and guessed regional installer values are ignored. Explicit app choices, including `system`, retain precedence, along with existing CLI/environment behavior. The settings dropdown displays the inherited default without writing app state. Both products share this policy and preserve existing registry/product identities. Compiled policy tests cover all 34 identities and saved-value preservation; rebuilt Linux locale interfaces passed. An isolated Windows registry round-trip test is added, but Windows CI and installed first-launch behavior remain pending. See `tests/results/localization/installer-app-handoff.json`.

### Windows checkout line-ending correction

Windows CI rejected activated installer generation because its init-hook anchor assumed LF while checkout files used CRLF. Activated build copies now normalize physical line endings to LF; source templates and default generation preserve their bytes. Regression tests verify identical activation output for LF, CRLF, and mixed inputs for both routes, and actual generated templates compiled again. The Windows packaging script now runs this activation suite directly. Current Windows qualification is pending; the earlier Linux compile evidence did not catch the checkout-specific failure. Evidence and failed-run identity are recorded in `tests/results/localization/installer-crlf-fix.json`.

### Localized Windows action shortcuts

Activated installers use catalog captions for uninstall, audio-driver setup, and cable settings. Setup-failure guidance names the same translated setup shortcut. The product folder, app shortcut identity, executable paths, and registry identities stay stable. Filename validation rejects unsafe/reserved Windows names and per-locale caption collisions. Update and uninstall enumerate exact known translated/legacy action-link names inside the product folder, retaining unrelated filenames; there is no wildcard or recursive Start-menu cleanup. Both route templates compiled and generation/cleanup tests passed. Installed shortcut execution, language-changing update, uninstall lifecycle, and native-speaker review remain unverified. Evidence: `tests/results/localization/localized-shortcuts.json`.

### Explicit UTF-8 in installer qualification tests

The Windows activation regression suite failed while reading generated multilingual NSIS source with implicit CP1252. The test infrastructure now uses explicit UTF-8 for generated scripts, review inventories, language maps, and fixture text. A modeled CP1252 default exercises the actual generation and shortcut checks; its negative control proves that omitting UTF-8 reproduces the decoding fault. Activation (5), mapping (3), and Swahili asset (3) tests passed locally, including compiler fixtures. Current Windows packaging/runtime qualification remains pending. Evidence: `tests/results/localization/installer-explicit-utf8.json`.

### Language chooser available during interactive updates

NSIS defaults suppress its language chooser after a preference is saved and apply codepage filtering. Activated builds now define `MUI_LANGDLL_ALWAYSSHOW` and `MUI_LANGDLL_ALLLANGUAGES`, enabling an interactive language-changing update and listing all 34 languages. The chooser title/prompt uses the existing translated Interface language caption. The installed NSIS macro reads the saved preference before its silent-mode guard, so silent updates retain it without displaying a chooser. Both route fixtures compiled and regression checks passed. Actual chooser rendering, persistence and language-changing installed update remain unqualified. See `tests/results/localization/installer-chooser.json`.

### Prepared installer locale lifecycle harness

`tests/windows_installer_locale_lifecycle.ps1` requires `-Run` and a clean independent Windows clone. It is restricted to the cable variant, verifies the installed helper before uninstall, and prepares a French/Nynorsk/Arabic saved-language install/update sequence. Assertions cover persisted tag, translated/stale shortcuts, helper arguments, settings/unknown-file preservation, an unrelated `.lnk` file, silent uninstall and PnP media-device state. Native ownership release and rendered chooser behavior are excluded. The inert fixture parses the harness and tests its pure expectation helper against all 34 catalogs; the no-Run guard passed. No real installation or VM was run. Evidence: `tests/results/localization/installer-locale-lifecycle-preparation.json`.

### Successful Windows previews and independent test clone

Successful Windows preview artifacts were downloaded and installer checksums matched their accompanying SHA-256 files; exact source heads and local paths are recorded in `windows-preview-download.json`. These are candidate packages, not installed qualification for the current head. A full flattened copy of the pristine template disk was created at idle I/O priority and registered as `soundcurrent-localization-win11-qa`, with independent firmware, 4 GiB RAM and two active vCPUs. QEMU metadata confirms no backing file. The clone remains shut off and has never been booted; originals, template and DAW state remain untouched. The lifecycle harness now accepts an optional older initial installer and records each installed candidate hash, enabling an actual preview-to-preview upgrade test. Inert checks passed; actual lifecycle testing remains pending.

### Brief independent-clone bootstrap

The independent clone was booted briefly, its MAC/DHCP/disk identity verified, and Windows completed initial device preparation to its lock screen. Two bounded SSH probes could not establish transport; no authentication or installer execution occurred. A graceful shutdown completed and the clone is confirmed off. Originals, the pristine template and DAW state were untouched. Older/current candidate installers are staged with exact checksums and source-run identities. Guest access setup remains necessary before actual lifecycle qualification; this bootstrap is not app/localization qualification. Evidence: `tests/results/localization/windows-clone-first-boot.json`.

### Read-only clone access setup media

The clone has no QEMU guest-agent channel. A small read-only ISO is attached to this clone only, containing a clone-only OpenSSH setup script and the existing public Ed25519 key. It contains no password or private key. The script requires an explicit Run switch and administrator context, uses Microsoft Windows capability installation when needed, and restricts inbound SSH to the host address. Its no-Run guard passed on the host. A bounded console attempt did not verify guest login or keyboard entry; the setup script and installers were not run. Graceful shutdown completed and the clone is confirmed off. Keyboard delivery must be qualified before another credential-entry attempt. Evidence: `tests/results/localization/windows-clone-access-preparation.json`.

### Display inventory and confirmed clone login

The literal display inventory now includes tab captions, informative text, status tips, and context help. Regression fixtures cover plain/wrapped captions and exclusion of translated/dynamic expressions. Fresh catalog checks report 746 declared messages across 34 catalogs, zero unfinished; this does not prove whole-interface coverage or native review. The independent Windows clone reached its desktop using the saved credential after a visible non-secret keyboard probe, then shut down gracefully. No setup script or app installer ran in that check. Current installed package qualification remains pending. Evidence: `tests/results/localization/display-inventory-extension.json`.

### Current Linux package lifecycle qualification

Run 37874411830 passed all three container environments for source eb6b7ef7711db1cfd406f6f0cd07c77768b8dbb7. Downloaded package checksums matched, and all 33 installed locale completion logs were verified per package. Build/CTest, install, same-package update, uninstall, settings sentinel preservation and reinstall passed. Package paths and SHA-256 identities are in `tests/results/localization/linux-current/report.json`. These container fixtures do not qualify actual RHEL desktop audio, arbitrary old-version migration, Windows, or native-speaker review. The Windows Arabic shortcut failure remains open.

### Loopback routing diagnostic

The invariant Windows loopback-route error now maps to a translated desktop message in all 33 non-English locales. Studio catalogs contain 747 declared messages with zero unfinished entries. Context distinguishes render capture from an echo effect and preserves the need for a separate playback source. Backend strings, route IDs and processing are unchanged. Contextual AI translations remain native-unverified; installed current-package qualification is pending. See `tests/results/localization/loopback-route-diagnostic.json`.

### WAVE render diagnostics

All 32 owned diagnostics inventoried in `src/wav.cpp` are mapped at the desktop display boundary and populated in all 34 catalogs (779 messages). Backend strings and parser behavior remain invariant. Context notes distinguish binary file metadata from live audio devices, clipping and tracks. Catalog and compiled injected-translator checks passed. Earlier Linux/Windows installed-package reports qualify their exact recorded heads; current 779-message package qualification remains pending. Native-language verification and whole-interface coverage remain unverified. See `tests/results/localization/wave-diagnostic-gap.json`.

### Standalone CLI field and channel errors

The CLI now localizes incorrect colon-separated field counts and invalid one-based channel indexes in all 34 catalogs. The actual compiled renderer rejects `--eq 1:100` and `--output-channels 0` with exact translated diagnostics in each language. The engine-only CTest passed. Translations have contextual AI review; native review remains unverified. CLI help and other CLI-specific messages remain open, and current-package qualification is pending.

### Shared engine diagnostics in the standalone renderer

The standalone renderer now embeds the existing desktop translations for all nine literal engine configuration rejections. Seven actual invalid-setting workflows per language exercise post gain, delay, reverb, channel gain and EQ frequency after loading a valid PCM16 WAV. The compiled CLI test passes in all 34 catalogs plus normalized/fallback tags. A source guard requires future literal engine rejections to be declared for CLI translation. Allocation failures and unavailable internal states have catalog checks only, not runtime fault injection. CLI help and remaining CLI-specific messages are still incomplete.

### Render-tail range diagnostic

The CLI tail-limit message now has contextually reviewed translations in all 34 catalogs. Tail means extra render time after the source ends, allowing effects to decay. Actual tests reject −1 and 31 seconds with localized errors; 0 and 30 seconds export successfully and differ by exactly 30 seconds of mono float32 frame data. Native review remains unverified. The standalone help and other untranslated diagnostics remain open.

### Existing-output protection in the standalone renderer

The CLI reuses the desktop translation for an already-existing output file through a display-boundary alias. Its underlying exception and no-overwrite behavior stay unchanged. Actual compiled tests across all 34 catalogs and fallback tags verify translated errors, unchanged existing file bytes and no leftover staging directory. The staging-directory creation error also embeds its existing desktop translation; collision exhaustion is not runtime qualified. CLI help and other diagnostics remain open.

### Unknown command-line options

The unknown-option template has translations in all 34 catalogs. The display boundary substitutes the supplied option exactly once before wrapping the diagnostic. Actual compiled tests check ordinary ASCII flags, colon-containing flags and literal `%1`/`%2` text in every language and fallback case. Windows Unicode argument decoding is not qualified by these ASCII cases and still needs an entry-point audit. Native review remains unverified; standalone help and other diagnostics remain incomplete.

### Windows Unicode renderer arguments

The standalone renderer uses a Windows `wmain` entry point, strict UTF-16 to UTF-8 conversion and explicit C++20 UTF-8 filesystem path construction. This follows [Microsoft’s wide entry-point documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-language/using-wmain?view=msvc-170) and [UTF-8 conversion API rules](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/stringapiset/nf-stringapiset-widechartomultibyte). Engine/library processing remains unchanged. Actual Linux CLI tests pass with accented, Cyrillic, CJK and emoji filenames and diagnostic option text. Windows-target MinGW syntax checking passes; native Windows runtime evidence remains pending CI. This supersedes the preceding ASCII-only test scope but does not claim Windows runtime qualification yet.

### Routing errors and native Unicode CLI qualification

Four routing/processing messages are translated across all 34 catalogs. Actual compiled tests reject route gains below −120 dB and above +12 dB in every catalog and fallback case. Internal matrix and buffer errors have compiled translation coverage but are not fault-injected. Native Windows 2022 and Ubuntu 24.04 engine CI run [37882316346](https://github.com/rhamenator/soundcurrent-studio/actions/runs/37882316346) passed all seven CTests, including Unicode CLI workflows, at the earlier 785-message commit `7c7e94e`. That evidence qualifies Unicode handling at that commit and does not qualify this later routing batch or desktop installers.

### Output-management diagnostic templates

Temporary-directory permission errors and local hard-link publication errors have translations in all 34 catalogs. A compiled display-boundary test preserves Unicode external filesystem detail and literal placeholder text; unknown partial-prefix exceptions retain their original text. This is diagnostic injection, not an actual permission or hard-link failure. Source guards now require all current owned CLI exception literals and both dynamic templates to be declared. Native review and real filesystem failure-path qualification remain unverified. CLI help and the successful-render summary are still untranslated, so whole-interface completion is not claimed.

### Successful standalone render summaries

Both summary lines have translations in all 34 catalogs. Actual compiled tests compare exact localized output from silent and deliberately clipped renders. The latter reports linear peak 7.92447, 128 clipped samples and zero invalid samples; WAV bytes have identical hashes across all language and fallback cases on the tested Linux build. Engine, DSP and model code are unchanged. One-pass formatting keeps substituted values literal and distinguishes `%10` from `%1`. Numeric text retains the CLI’s invariant representation. Native review and current Windows/package qualification remain unverified; CLI help is still untranslated.

### Standalone help heading and usage

The renderer heading, usage template and one-based channel/no-overwrite explanation are translated in all 34 catalogs. Actual compiled tests compare these help lines for both `--help` and missing required input/output arguments. Executable name, flags and example filenames remain literal. File-based wording avoids a network-disconnection implication in Bokmål, Nynorsk and Swahili. Native review remains unverified. Option descriptions and the input/output format footer are still English, so help translation is incomplete.

### First four standalone help options

Language selection, output channel count, explicit routing and per-channel peaking EQ descriptions are translated in all 34 catalogs. Exact compiled help-line tests preserve command flags, argument tokens and whitespace. Context review confirms that explicit routing removes default routes rather than restoring them. Thirteen option descriptions and the format footer remain English. Earlier native Windows/Linux engine CI [37883666514](https://github.com/rhamenator/soundcurrent-studio/actions/runs/37883666514) passed all eight CTests at the 796-message commit `7c78ba7`, including the CRLF correction; it excludes this later 800-message batch. Native-speaker review and current package qualification remain unverified.

### Filter and gain help

Low-pass, high-pass, channel trim and global post-gain descriptions are translated in all 34 catalogs and checked in actual compiled help. Low-pass passes low frequencies; high-pass passes high frequencies. Channel trim retains −60 to +24 dB while post gain retains −84 to +24 dB. Shared validation in EQ and Studio rejects changed signs, bounds, units and the LFE identifier, with positive/negative mutation checks in both repositories. Native review remains unverified. Nine descriptions and the format footer are still English.

### Delay and reverb help

Six effect-option descriptions are translated in all 34 catalogs and checked in actual compiled help. Wet mix denotes processed-signal share; feedback, decay and damping are reviewed against engine behavior. Decimal examples retain the CLI parser’s syntax. Arabic reverb help and its range error now match the existing audio-reverberation terminology. Shared guards in both repositories use token boundaries to reject extended numeric values and avoid counting `ms` inside the Swahili word for default. Native review remains unverified. Three option descriptions and the format footer remain English.

### Complete current standalone help

The three remaining descriptions and WAVE format footer are translated in all 34 catalogs. Actual compiled tests compare every one of the 21 help lines, including immutable flag/argument syntax, for normal help and missing required paths. A source guard rejects undeclared help prose. Shared guards preserve WAVE format identifiers and repeated float32 tokens. Bypass retains routing and final sample protection; disabling headroom disables EQ gain compensation only. Python is explicitly a build dependency in RPM metadata and package-validation containers; no new Python runtime dependency is introduced. Native review, current Windows/package qualification and the whole-application interface audit remain separate and unverified.

### Standard editing menus (2026-10-09)

Qt line-edit and rich-text context menus now use the application catalog for Undo, Redo, Cut, Copy, Paste, Delete and Select all. Spin-box increment/decrement captions use the same catalog. Mapping is limited to the relevant Qt contexts; unrelated plugin strings retain their original behavior. Qt retains its keyboard shortcuts. The eight added captions were reviewed in their text-editing/numeric context and populated in all 33 non-English catalogs; native-speaker verification remains pending. Actual line-edit and rich-text menus are checked in the compiled localization test. The actual spin popup is opened and its translated increment is selected with Return, verifying a 0.5 numeric step. Both offscreen and X11 backends passed locally; native Windows interaction remains pending. No local VM was started for this change.

#### Linux platform-theme qualification

The X11 run initially exposed English Save/Close captions through Qt’s `QGnomeTheme`, which the offscreen backend had not exercised. Standard button mapping now accepts that context and its mnemonic markers. GNOME’s “Close without Saving” maps to the existing translated Discard action. All 18 standard button captions are tested in every non-English catalog, alongside the actual text and numeric menus. These checks run with both offscreen and X11 backends in Linux CI; the numeric popup remains inside an isolated test application and does not change playback settings or the system clipboard.

### Dynamic display audit

Run `python3 scripts/ui_string_audit.py --dynamic` to inventory composed arguments to known Qt display methods and constructors. The retained inventory includes hashes of the inspected source files. An inline translation call is informational: an expression can still contain untranslated fragments. Stored names, external device descriptions, catalog-backed helper results, numeric formatting and synthetic test captions require separate provenance classification. Overloaded methods and helper declarations can appear in this lexical inventory; it is not a C++ semantic analysis or a whole-interface coverage certificate.

Linux package run 37886571464 qualified the 822-message catalog at its recorded product source commit across Ubuntu 24.04, Fedora 44 and AlmaLinux 10. Package hashes and 99 installed locale completion logs are retained under `tests/results/localization/linux-822-installed/`. This covers same-package update, removal, configuration preservation and reinstall; it does not establish native-speaker review, a physical RHEL desktop or older-version migration.
