# Translation review — 2026-10-07

## Current catalog status — 2026-10-08

All 632 currently extracted source messages have populated translations in all 33 non-English catalogs, including Nynorsk. There are 34 catalogs including English. This count describes catalog coverage; it does not establish that every user-facing string has been extracted. Missing interface strings remain a separate second pass, as requested.

The dated checkpoints below document earlier states and contextual AI review. Their incomplete-language counts are historical, not current status. Automated structural and compiled-catalog checks do not prove linguistic accuracy. Native-speaker verification remains unverified for every non-English locale. Runtime qualification is tracked separately in tests/results/localization. Current Linux lifecycle checks pass on Ubuntu, Fedora and AlmaLinux fixtures. Both current application builds passed Windows installed-package fixtures. An older EQ binary triggered a Defender detection whose false-positive status remains unresolved. Visual review is partial and interactive installer/startup qualification remains pending. No release is authorized by this checkpoint.

## Scope and evidence

A contextual AI review examined the 30 starter strings in each of 32 unverified languages (960 translated entries). This is an internal review, not an independent review or native-speaker certification. No external translator service was used. Remaining untranslated strings were not certified by this review.

Corrections address clear semantic risks and ambiguous audio terminology: Swahili gain previously used a word for profit and bands a word for belts; frequency-band labels were made explicit in several languages; flat-response labels/reset actions were clarified; Hungarian regional settings and Vietnamese audio/preset labels were improved. These replacement translations remain unverified themselves.

`data/localization/translation-context.json` supplies technical definitions in generated Qt Linguist translator notes. Gain means a signed signal-level adjustment in dB; flat means zero EQ gain, not mute; balance means left/right channel level; Quit exits the process while closing the window leaves it running. Notes are shared between the applications and can be reused by the DAW.

## Remaining uncertainty

French, German, Spanish, Italian and both Portuguese variants, Dutch and Polish are populated; the other 24 language packs remain incomplete. All 32 lack native review. Particular review priorities are Swahili audio vocabulary, Thai preset wording, natural microphone EQ terminology in every language, and regional Portuguese and Chinese usage. An AI reread or back-translation by the same model is not independent evidence and must not be labeled native review. Do not promote catalog review status based on this pass.

## Required review workflow

1. Review the English source and actual control behavior with the translator notes. Resolve ambiguous source wording before translating it.
2. A fluent reviewer should compare each target string directly with that intent and flag wrong meaning, unintended connotations, register, regional usage, spelling and unnatural phrasing. Back-translation can help identify questions, but does not replace this comparison.
3. Check strings in the running interface, including RTL, truncation, mnemonics, decimal entry, and complete error messages. Verify Quit, reset and lock semantics explicitly.
4. Record reviewer identity/locale, date, catalog commit, corrections and unresolved issues before setting nativeReviewed. Any later edited strings require renewed review.
5. Keep uncertain entries unfinished so they fall back to English. Keep partial-language coverage visible. Full language qualification also requires the release gates in localization.md.

## Automated checks

Catalog audit checks source inventory, duplicate keys, nonempty finished entries, exact placeholders, literal `&&` preservation, absence of hidden bidi override/isolate controls, coverage and compiled-catalog hashes. The interface supplies RTL direction explicitly. These checks verify structural integrity, not translation accuracy or cultural appropriateness.

## Localization completion checkpoint

The French catalog is now populated for all currently extracted app messages (437 EQ / 523 Studio). Translation and contextual review were performed by this coding agent; no external provider or fluent-speaker certification was used. Coverage includes help, equipment validation, calibration preview, standard Qt actions and Studio render/status text. Every French entry remains unverified. German, Spanish, Italian and both Portuguese variants are also populated; the other 26 languages retain their starter coverage. The independent localization-guard audit agrees with populated coverage; its linguistic/runtime qualification fields remain unknown because that tool cannot assess them. Compiled/runtime evidence is recorded separately in tests/results/localization/checkpoint.json.

## German completion checkpoint

All current EQ/Studio catalog entries are populated in German (437 / 523). This coding agent reviewed the supplied text against actual control meaning: Verstärkung is audio gain; Pegelreserve is headroom; Ohne Effekt is dry signal; Pegelkorrektur is channel trim, not file cutting; Loudness-Korrektur is the listening preset, not a loudness measurement; Rückkopplung is delay feedback. Profile type IDs, user/vendor names, rich-text links, extensions, placeholders and saved processing values remain invariant. Filter Q replaces the imprecise Width (Q) source caption. This is contextual AI review and remains unverified, not native-speaker certification.

## Spanish completion checkpoint

All current catalog entries are populated in Spanish (437 EQ / 523 Studio). Contextual AI review distinguishes Ganancia (audio gain), Factor Q del filtro (dimensionless filter quality), Plano (zero EQ gain), Compensación de sonoridad (low-volume listening correction), Sin efecto (dry signal), and Tiempo de relajación del compresor (compressor release). Manufacturer names, profiles, placeholders, URLs and file filters remain invariant. These translations remain unverified; this does not constitute native-speaker review.

## Italian completion checkpoint

All current extracted entries are populated (437 EQ / 523 Studio). Contextual AI review distinguishes Guadagno (signed audio gain), Fattore Q del filtro, Piatto (zero EQ gain), Compensazione loudness (low-volume listening correction), Senza effetto (dry signal), Rilascio del compressore and Annulla modifica (undo, distinct from Annulla for cancellation). Stable IDs, vendor/user metadata, links, file filters and placeholders remain unchanged. No native-speaker certification was obtained; all entries remain unverified.

## Portuguese regional completion checkpoint

Both pt-PT and pt-BR catalogs populate all currently extracted messages (437 EQ / 523 Studio each). Regional contextual review uses coluna/alto-falante, auscultadores/fones de ouvido, ficheiro/arquivo, guardar/salvar, controlos/controles, recetor/receptor, varrimento/varredura and percentagem/porcentagem. Technical intent preserves zero-gain Plano, low-volume Compensação loudness, Sem efeito for dry signal and signed gain adjustments. Compressor release is Tempo de recuperação do compressor in pt-PT and Tempo de liberação do compressor in pt-BR. This is contextual AI review, unverified; no native-speaker certification is claimed.

## Dutch completion checkpoint

All current extracted entries are populated (437 EQ / 523 Studio). Contextual AI review uses Versterking for signed audio gain, Filter-Q for quality factor, Vlak for zero EQ gain, Loudnesscompensatie for low-volume listening compensation, Zonder effect for dry signal, Hersteltijd van compressor for release and Ongedaan maken for undo. Vendor metadata, machine IDs, file filters, placeholders and source links remain invariant. All entries remain unverified; no native-speaker review is claimed.

## Polish completion checkpoint

All current extracted entries are populated (437 EQ / 523 Studio). Contextual AI review uses Wzmocnienie for signed audio gain, Dobroć filtra Q for dimensionless quality factor, Płaska charakterystyka for zero EQ gain, Kompensacja loudness for low-volume listening compensation, Bez efektu for dry signal, and Czas powrotu kompresora for release. Render counts use Wyrenderowane kanały: %1 to avoid an incorrect fixed grammatical ending. Placeholder-containing route and microphone captions avoid requiring declension of inserted names. Machine IDs, file filters, links and saved parameters remain invariant. All entries remain unverified; no native-speaker review is claimed.

## Czech and Slovak initial batch

Reviewed prompts against actual import, correction-preview, calibration and audio setup behavior. Signed gain uses zesílení/zosilnenie; headroom uses rezerva; meter text retains the estimated-level qualifier. Dynamic route types use a neutral label construction to avoid inflecting inserted names. Device identities, placeholders and numerical settings remain unchanged. Both catalogs remain incomplete and unverified; no native-speaker review is claimed.

Czech/Slovak second batch: wet mix is the effect contribution, not total output volume; delay time is distinct from decay time. Sweep error text explicitly describes a continuously changing test frequency. Failure prompts preserve the conditions under which processing is refused and the app stays open. This is contextual AI review, not native-speaker verification.

Czech/Slovak filter and measurement review: Q is a dimensionless quality factor, shelving differs from pass filtering, compressor attack/release differs from effect decay, and makeup is gain compensation. Loudness describes low-volume tonal compensation. Estimated level labels retain that qualifier. Published model correction remains additive to listening EQ and does not claim room/amplifier calibration. Native-speaker review remains unverified.

## Czech and Slovak completed extracted catalogs

All current extracted entries populated (441 EQ / 527 Studio). The review distinguishes compressor makeup from post gain, pass filters from shelving, measured response from inverted EQ correction and effects from microphone correction.

File filters, markup URLs, placeholders, IDs and saved numeric parameters are unchanged. Catalogs remain unverified; no native-speaker review is claimed.

## Ukrainian and Russian initial batches

Translated independently with Ukrainian підсилення/чіткість and Russian усиление/чёткость. Dynamic equipment names use neutral constructions to avoid forcing noun declension. Inspection of enhancement.cpp confirms ambience damping reduces high-frequency content in the feedback path; decay describes duration. Estimated-meter qualifiers, clipping warnings and safe failure/paused-state messages remain explicit. This is contextual AI review; both catalogs are incomplete and native-speaker verification remains unverified.

Ukrainian/Russian filter and measurement review: добротність/добротность identifies dimensionless filter Q; компенсаційне/компенсационное підсилення/усиление distinguishes compressor makeup from post gain. Тонкомпенсація/тонкомпенсация means low-volume tone compensation. Negative route gain explicitly reverses polarity. Calibration continues to require a system measurement for room/amplifier effects, and labels distinguish estimated output from measured microphone response. Catalogs remain unverified.

Ukrainian/Russian startup and render review: render-channel and clipped-sample counts use labels to avoid a fixed plural suffix. Profile editing preserves the measured reference and saves a custom copy. Quit/reopen remains distinct from closing the window. Device-setup changes retain the restart warning and possible playback interruption. Structural checks preserve source hyperlinks and placeholders; native-speaker verification remains unverified.

## Ukrainian and Russian completed extracted catalogs

All currently extracted messages populated (441 EQ / 527 Studio). Q uses добротність/добротность; signed gain uses підсилення/усиление; tone compensation uses тонкомпенсація/тонкомпенсация.

Native review remains unverified.

Greek/Turkish measurement review: loudness is low-volume tonal compensation rather than a global volume increase. Greek offline rendering describes non-real-time processing to avoid implying an internet requirement. Negative route gain means polarity inversion. Correction remains additive and microphone clipping requires reducing input gain/boost. Preset and profile limits preserve numerical meaning; native review remains unverified.

Greek/Turkish startup/render review: sign-in differs from a boot-time service; enabling one app replaces the shared registration. Quitting differs from closing the window. Profile-save instructions preserve the reference copy. Rendering summaries use labels for arbitrary channel and clipped-sample counts. Link text is localized while href attributes remain unchanged. Native review remains unverified.

Exit actions retain normal-audio restoration. Native review remains unverified.

Swedish/Danish measurement review: loudnesskompensation describes low-volume tonal compensation. Negative linear route gain is explicit polarity inversion. Balance attenuates the opposite channel rather than boosting the selected one. Measurement conditions, conservative model corrections and microphone clipping warnings preserve their original limits. Native review remains unverified.

Swedish/Danish startup/render review: sign-in remains a per-user registration; selecting one SoundCurrent app replaces the other registration. Saving an edited equipment response creates a custom copy and preserves the reference. Offline rendering remains distinct from live processing. Render summaries use neutral count labels. Calibration links retain their exact destinations. Native review remains unverified.

Swedish/Danish import and speaker-profile review: frekvensgång/frekvensgang describes frequency response.

## Romanian and Hungarian initial batch

Câștig/erősítés describes gain; rezervă de nivel/szinttartalék describes headroom, distinct from balance. Clipping warnings retain potential distortion, while dynamic boost retains its peak ceiling. Ambience damping and decay remain separate controls. Amplifier profiles require electrical measurements with known load and settings; marketing specifications are insufficient.

Relative measurements include the microphone; measured response differs from inverted correction. Rendering summaries use labels for arbitrary counts. URLs, file filters, placeholders, machine IDs and numerical settings are preserved. Catalogs remain unverified; native-speaker review is not claimed.

## Nynorsk initial batch

Nynorsk is its own written standard and catalog, separate from Bokmål. Wording uses innstillingar, einingar, forsterking and førehandsinnstilling consistently. Nivåmargin remains distinct from balance, and clipping warnings retain estimated peak risk. Amplifier profiles require electrical measurement, not marketing specifications. Setup recovery preserves an open app with paused processing. Regional language selection retains nn and nb separately. Native review remains unverified.

Nynorsk recovery review: inability to inspect active equalizers explicitly prevents handsaming. Setup errors keep the app open. Limits and half-dB steps retain their values.

## Nynorsk completed extracted catalogs

All currently extracted messages populated (441 EQ / 527 Studio). Q remains dimensionless quality, headroom is level margin, compressor makeup differs from post gain, and wet mix is effect contribution. Low-volume loudness compensation differs from output volume. Relative measurements include the microphone; measured response differs from inverted correction. Rendering summaries use labels for arbitrary counts. URLs, file filters, placeholders, machine IDs and numerical settings are preserved. Catalogs remain unverified; native-speaker review is not claimed.

## Arabic initial batch

الكسب describes gain; هامش المستوى describes headroom, distinct from channel balance. قص قمم الإشارة describes clipped signal peaks. Room-effect damping differs from decay duration. Amplifier curves require electrical measurements with known load and settings; marketing specifications are insufficient. Processing pauses during setup and recovery keeps the app open. Placeholders, units and file/character limits remain unchanged. Arabic EQ was sampled at 1280×720; full bidi and native-speaker review remain unverified.

## Second-pass dialog titles and percentages (2026-10-08)

The amplifier confirmation title refers to applying measured response correction
through EQ, not adjusting the hardware gain or changing firmware. The conflict
title refers to competing software processing/routing ownership, not distortion
or an acoustic measurement failure. Both titles received contextual AI review
and translations in all 33 non-English catalogs. Arabic wording explicitly
identifies audio-equalization software. Native-speaker verification remains
unverified for these additions.

Tray Open and equalizer state captions reuse existing translations. Enhancement
amount labels now use the selected regional digits and percent symbol at
initialization, live edits and settings restoration; numerical processing is
unchanged. Per-locale Qt fixtures exercise all five percentage controls.

The literal Qt inventory does not cover every dynamic expression, saved/user
name, backend diagnostic or installer message. Its remaining language-picker
caption `English (en)` is an intentional native autonym plus stable locale tag.
Whole-interface coverage remains incomplete.

## Amplifier preview and details prose (second pass, 2026-10-08)

All 33 non-English catalogs now translate the measurement-condition label,
source label, conditional apply warning and correction-filter heading. The
warning refers to using a measured amplifier response only with matching
electrical load, input and tone settings. It is not a recommendation to copy
a curve measured with a different speaker load. Contextual review is AI review;
native-speaker verification remains unverified.

Profile names, original measurement conditions, attribution URLs and filter
JSON remain supplied data. Display-only direction isolates keep that content
separate from the translated surrounding prose, without changing stored values.
Every locale fixture checks names and conditions containing literal `%1`/`%2`,
URL escapes, and numerical/filter JSON so placeholder substitution cannot
rewrite imported content. This checks strings and data boundaries; full native
dialog visual qualification remains a later package gate.

## Speaker details (second pass, 2026-10-08)

The measurement-attribution label, correction policy and peaking/low-shelf/high-
shelf names are now translated in all 33 non-English catalogs. Contextual AI
review distinguishes bell-shaped peaking EQ from peak/clipping indicators and
shelving EQ from low/high-pass cutoff filters. Established technical shelving
loanwords are retained where appropriate. Native-speaker verification remains
unverified.

The policy describes correction-only gain ±6 dB, Q at most 6, and omitted
positive-gain filters below 80 Hz. These match the unchanged speaker-profile
loader validation. Listening preset EQ is added separately and can exceed those
correction-only limits. Numbers are now regional display values, while processing
and stored profile fields are unchanged.

Published names, attribution and URLs remain supplied content. Display isolates
keep numerical/unit tokens and URLs together. The details dialog explicitly uses
plain text. All locale fixtures test the attribution boundary, negative gain,
frequency/Q formatting, URLs and policy tokens; native dialog layout/glyph
qualification still belongs to the final package tests.

## Second pass: stable equipment taxonomy keys

Speaker and equipment-library subtype dropdowns now store the original equipmentType key in item data. Filtering and refresh no longer depend on display text. Regression fixtures replace a caption with French/Japanese text and verify the speaker results and preserved subtype selection. All 34 equipment UI tests and 38 shared/localized/catalog tests passed on Linux with Qt offscreen. Built-in taxonomy labels still need translation; this prerequisite does not establish full interface coverage or Windows qualification. Native-speaker verification remains unverified.
