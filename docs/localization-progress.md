# Localization completion work

## Goal and repository scope

The user replaced the Windows virtual-driver implementation goal with localization fixes on 2026-10-07. Driver code is preserved. This work owns EQ and Studio; the DAW is maintained in its separate chat. Published 1.1.0 assets remain unchanged; no new release is authorized by this continuation.

## Baseline and source review

The independent localization-guard handoff reported 30/318 translated strings in EQ and 30/397 in Studio for each of 32 target locales. It checked catalogs, not completeness of source extraction or compiled/live views.

Review found missing equipment dialog titles/actions, validation reasons, microphone connection text, operational error messages and Studio render messages. These now enter the catalogs. Complete messages replace concatenated prompt/conflict/version fragments. Qt standard action captions share the embedded translation catalog. Raw external backend diagnostics and OS-native dialog text may retain their original language.

The review also fixed two functional bugs: source/conditions length limits depended on translated labels, and equipment-kind filtering used display text as a schema value. Limits are now explicit and selectors retain stable speaker/microphone/amplifier data. Brand/family/model names and user-supplied profile content remain literal. SDK/DSP implementation and driver sources were not modified.

## Current checkpoint

- Populated catalogs: de, fr, es, it, pt-PT, pt-BR, nl, pl, cs, sk, uk, ru, el, tr, sv, da, nb, fi, ro, hu, nn, ar, he, fa, zh-Hans, zh-Hant, ja, ko, hi, id, vi, th, sw; 547 extracted messages each. These are unverified translations; nativeReviewed remains false.
- All original target locales and added Nynorsk have populated current catalogs; omitted application messages still require the second pass. Exact counts and compiled hashes are authoritative in data/localization/catalogs.json.
- Coverage is distinct from contextual AI review, native-speaker verification and runtime qualification. Checkpoint reports in tests/results/localization identify tested catalogs, platforms and scopes.
- Runtime supports separate UI language and number/date locale selection, regional/script fallback, pseudo localization and RTL. Maintenance preserves unfinished edits/comments and rejects unsupported numerus before rewriting.
- Shared interface layout now wraps meter guidance; the curve instruction also wraps for longer translated text.

## Completion criteria

Populate all current messages for every existing locale, pass structural and compiled/live UI checks on Linux/Windows, validate changed packages, and record evidence/known limitations. Full populated coverage must never be labeled native-speaker verification without an identified reviewer and catalog-specific evidence. The global --require-complete gate passes for the current catalogs; this does not prove that every application-owned message has been extracted. No arbitrary English copies should be inserted merely to pass coverage.

Next work: second-pass inventory and localization of omitted application-owned messages. French, German, Spanish and Italian are required to stay populated as sources evolve. The Filter Q caption now describes the dimensionless filter quality parameter; saved processing IDs and numeric values are unchanged.

Windows audio setup now translates application-owned failure, repair, calibration and restart instructions. Restart-required results always retain the translated reboot instruction alongside original helper diagnostics. The source guard also rejects unmarked literal messages passed to the setup completion helper.

Spanish: all 523 extracted messages populated. Contextual AI review covers calibration safety, flat gain, low-volume loudness compensation, dry/wet mixing, compressor timing, routing and filter Q. Native-speaker verification remains unverified. Spanish equipment import/edit/save workflows and inert Windows setup-message fixtures are included in the test gates.

Italian: all 523 extracted messages populated. Full Linux CTest passed 53/53, including Italian equipment workflows. Settings/effects tabs inspected with xcb/Xvfb at 1280×720. Contextual AI review remains unverified; Windows qualification for the new catalogs is pending.

Portuguese partial checkpoint: 237/523 messages populated for each regional variant. Linux compiled-catalog and both Portuguese main-window checks passed (3/3). Regional terminology is reviewed separately; the remainder stays unfinished and falls back to English. Native-speaker verification remains unverified.

Portuguese completed checkpoint: all 523 extracted messages populated in both regional catalogs. Full Linux CTest passed 55/55, including both equipment workflows. Regional settings/effects tabs inspected at 1280×720. Structural completeness is required for future updates; all translations remain unverified. Prior Italian commits passed Windows CI.

Dutch: all 523 extracted messages populated. Full Linux CTest passed 56/56 before the meter-help wrapping adjustment. The localized equipment import/edit/save workflow is included. Meter-help text now wraps instead of forcing a wider EQ page. Contextual review remains unverified; current Windows qualification pending.

Layout follow-up: four targeted Dutch/Spanish/pseudo-locale checks passed after wrapping the meter-help label. Inspected Dutch EQ/Studio and Spanish EQ screenshots at 1280×720. The EQ page no longer needs page-wide horizontal scrolling in these samples; the frequency-band strip keeps its own scroll control. Prior Portuguese commits passed Windows CI.

Polish: all 523 extracted messages populated. Full Linux CTest passed 57/57 before one final plot-caption wording correction; focused runtime/UI/equipment tests cover the final catalog separately. Contextual review distinguishes signed gain, filter Q, flat response, low-volume loudness correction and count-independent render summaries. Native-speaker verification remains unverified; current Windows qualification pending.

Polish final catalog: three focused runtime/main-window/equipment checks passed. After curve-instruction wrapping, three Polish/pseudo-locale checks passed. Small-screen inspection still shows Polish EQ horizontal scrolling and partially offscreen headroom; layout qualification remains incomplete. The user also requested optional startup at sign-in for both apps; implement this alongside localization, preserving mutual exclusion and leaving it disabled by default.

Startup option: implemented in Settings for both apps. One shared per-user registration chooses EQ or Studio. Background launch has a visible-window fallback when no tray is available. Linux full tests passed 58/58. Windows build/installer and actual sign-in qualification remain pending. See startup.md.

### Swahili existing catalog complete

All 527/527 current Swahili catalog entries are populated. Required-complete and regional fallback gates now include Swahili. Full Linux CTest passed 84/84, including profile workflows and all locale MainWindow offscreen checks. The global catalog completeness gate passes. Translations remain unverified; Windows and visual qualification are pending. Omitted source strings remain scheduled for the second pass.

### Second-pass source inventory

Added `scripts/localization_inventory.py` and its generated `tests/results/localization/source-inventory.json`. This read-only discovery aid scans literal C++ exceptions and selected view calls across all source files, NSIS candidates and Python diagnostics. Counts are candidates, not confirmed untranslated user messages. Dynamic/composed strings, shell/PowerShell helpers, native dialogs and data-driven names still require review. Current catalog completeness checks continue to pass.

Confirmed first adapter targets: missing Windows audio-route instructions, disconnected speakers, invalid equalizer/microphone settings; Studio also has live-layout and invalid Studio-setting messages. Translate at the Qt adapter/view boundary while preserving backend identifiers and numeric processing. Installer strings require their own language selection and catalog workflow. The existing full Linux 82/82 (EQ) and 84/84 (Studio) results predate this informational tooling change; no new runtime qualification is claimed.

### Second-pass Windows adapter errors in progress

Qt adapter errors now use translation markers; a regression guard rejects direct untranslated exception literals. Seven new EQ / nine new Studio source messages entered the catalogs, including bridge-start fallback errors. German and French translations have been supplied; other locales remain unfinished and fall back to English. The required-complete gate is intentionally failing until the new translations are filled. Seven catalog-maintenance regressions passed in each repository. No Windows runtime qualification or new full-suite pass is claimed.

Second-pass adapter translation checkpoint: German, French, Spanish, Italian, European/Brazilian Portuguese, Dutch and Polish now populate all newly exposed adapter messages. Structural checks passed for these eight locales; seven catalog-maintenance regression tests passed in each repository. Other locales still need the seven EQ / nine Studio new messages, so the global completeness gate remains failing. Work remains local until that batch is complete; translations remain unverified.

Second-pass adapter translation checkpoint: added Czech, Slovak, Ukrainian, Russian, Greek and Turkish. Fourteen locales now populate all newly exposed adapter messages and pass structural checks. Seven catalog-maintenance regressions passed in each repository. The other nineteen non-English locales still need these messages, so the global completeness gate remains failing. Changes remain local; runtime qualification for this batch is pending and translations are unverified.

Second-pass adapter translation checkpoint: added Swedish, Danish, Norwegian Bokmål/Nynorsk, Finnish, Romanian and Hungarian. Twenty-one locales now populate all newly exposed adapter messages and pass structural checks. Seven catalog-maintenance regressions passed in each repository. Twelve non-English locales still need these messages; the global completeness gate remains failing. Work remains local, translations unverified and runtime qualification pending.

Second-pass adapter translation checkpoint: added Arabic, Hebrew, Persian, Simplified/Traditional Chinese, Japanese and Korean. Twenty-eight locales now populate all newly exposed adapter messages and pass structural checks. Seven catalog-maintenance regressions passed in each repository. Hindi, Indonesian, Vietnamese, Thai and Swahili still need these messages; the global completeness gate remains failing. Work remains local, translations unverified and runtime qualification pending.

### Second-pass Qt Windows adapter messages complete

All 33 non-English locales now cover the new seven EQ / nine Studio messages. Global required-complete and structural checks pass. Both apps rebuilt and passed two focused Linux checks; compiled message loading and Unicode exception round-trip run across non-English locales. The adapter rejects unmarked literal exception messages in source regression checks. Backend diagnostics and installers remain separate second-pass work. Translations are unverified; Windows/device/installer qualification is pending. Earlier in-progress checkpoints describe historical states.

### Backend diagnostic translation boundary

Added a shared Qt desktop-only audio-error mapper. The invariant Windows backend diagnostic “The selected EQ settings are invalid” now displays the existing translated equalizer-settings message. Unknown driver diagnostics retain their exact text and Unicode details. The backend remains Qt-independent and its diagnostics/processing identifiers are unchanged. Both builds passed catalog completeness and two focused Linux checks, including mapping across non-English locales. Other backend diagnostics still require cataloging; Windows runtime and package qualification remain pending.

### Backend literal diagnostics in progress

Extended the Qt desktop boundary to direct literal Windows audio/capture errors, including unsupported formats, buffer overrun and stalled microphone consumption. Each app adds eleven applicable catalog messages; backend diagnostic IDs and DSP code remain unchanged. Microphone and calibration display paths now use the same mapping. German/French translations pass structural checks; seven catalog-maintenance regressions pass. Remaining locales, HRESULT/composed diagnostics and runtime/package qualification remain incomplete. The global completeness gate is failing for the new untranslated entries. Changes remain local and translations unverified.

Backend literal translation checkpoint: added Spanish, Italian, European/Brazilian Portuguese, Dutch and Polish. Eight locales now populate all applicable new backend literal messages; structural checks and seven catalog-maintenance regressions passed. Twenty-five non-English locales remain. Changes remain local; no runtime qualification is claimed and translations remain unverified.

Backend literal translation checkpoint: added Czech, Slovak, Ukrainian, Russian, Greek and Turkish. Fourteen locales now populate the applicable new backend messages. Structural checks and seven catalog-maintenance regressions passed in each repository. Nineteen locales remain. Changes remain local, translations unverified and runtime qualification pending.

Backend literal translation checkpoint: added Swedish, Danish, Norwegian Bokmål/Nynorsk, Finnish, Romanian and Hungarian. Twenty-one locales populate all applicable new backend messages. Structural checks and seven catalog-maintenance regressions passed in each repository. Twelve locales remain; changes are local and translations unverified. Runtime/package qualification remains pending.

Backend literal translation checkpoint: added Arabic, Hebrew, Persian, both Chinese variants, Japanese and Korean. Twenty-eight locales populate the applicable new messages. Structural checks and seven catalog-maintenance regressions passed in each repository. Hindi, Indonesian, Vietnamese, Thai and Swahili remain. Changes are local, translations unverified and runtime/package qualification pending.

### Backend literal diagnostic batch complete

All 33 non-English locales now cover the eleven applicable direct-literal backend messages per app. Global required-complete and structural checks pass. Both apps rebuilt and passed two focused Linux checks, including compiled translations, known diagnostic mapping and preservation of unknown Unicode details. Backend/DSP sources remain unchanged. HRESULT/composed diagnostics, helper and installer messages, visual and Windows/package qualification remain outstanding. Translations remain unverified. Earlier in-progress checkpoints describe historical states.
