# Localization completion work

## Goal and repository scope

The user replaced the Windows virtual-driver implementation goal with localization fixes on 2026-10-07. Driver code is preserved. This work owns EQ and Studio; the DAW is maintained in its separate chat. Published 1.1.0 assets remain unchanged; no new release is authorized by this continuation.

## Baseline and source review

The independent localization-guard handoff reported 30/318 translated strings in EQ and 30/397 in Studio for each of 32 target locales. It checked catalogs, not completeness of source extraction or compiled/live views.

Review found missing equipment dialog titles/actions, validation reasons, microphone connection text, operational error messages and Studio render messages. These now enter the catalogs. Complete messages replace concatenated prompt/conflict/version fragments. Qt standard action captions share the embedded translation catalog. Raw external backend diagnostics and OS-native dialog text may retain their original language.

The review also fixed two functional bugs: source/conditions length limits depended on translated labels, and equipment-kind filtering used display text as a schema value. Limits are now explicit and selectors retain stable speaker/microphone/amplifier data. Brand/family/model names and user-supplied profile content remain literal. SDK/DSP implementation and driver sources were not modified.

## Current checkpoint

- French: all 437 extracted EQ messages and all 523 extracted Studio messages populated, including standard actions, help and errors. Contextual AI translation/review only; nativeReviewed remains false.
- German: all 437 extracted EQ messages and all 523 extracted Studio messages populated. Contextual AI review covers audio terminology, safe calibration/update instructions, and standard actions; nativeReviewed remains false.
- Other 30 locales: 30 core entries populated each; the remaining messages must be translated and reviewed in subsequent batches.
- Locale selection: region-only Chinese and explicit Latin-script Portuguese aliases resolve to available catalogs; formatting extensions do not block fallback; unsupported explicit scripts remain rejected.
- Maintenance: preserve unfinished translator work/comments; reject unsupported numerus before rewriting; validate placeholders, markup/hyperlinks, glob filters, resource inventory and compiled hashes; prevent regressions in previously populated locales.
- Qualification: run real main-window fixtures for all 32 languages plus pseudo locales; test French and German equipment import/edit/save and field limits; inspect translated tabs at small-screen size. Windows checks and package validation are tracked on the review PRs.

## Completion criteria

Populate all current messages for every existing locale, pass structural and compiled/live UI checks on Linux/Windows, validate changed packages, and record evidence/known limitations. Full populated coverage must never be labeled native-speaker verification without an identified reviewer and catalog-specific evidence. The global --require-complete gate will remain failing until all missing entries are filled. No arbitrary English copies should be inserted merely to pass coverage.

Next translation batch: Spanish. French and German are required to stay populated as sources evolve. The Filter Q caption now describes the dimensionless filter quality parameter; saved processing IDs and numeric values are unchanged.

Windows audio setup now translates application-owned failure, repair, calibration and restart instructions. Restart-required results always retain the translated reboot instruction alongside original helper diagnostics. The source guard also rejects unmarked literal messages passed to the setup completion helper.

Spanish batch in progress: 216/437 EQ and 237/523 Studio messages populated. Compiled-catalog and Spanish main-window tests passed on Linux. Coverage is partial and linguistic review remains unverified. Windows fixture staging was corrected after CI found that the setup script is not yet present before installer assembly.
