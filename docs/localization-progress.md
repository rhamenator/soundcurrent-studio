# Localization completion work

## Goal and repository scope

The user replaced the Windows virtual-driver implementation goal with localization fixes on 2026-10-07. Driver code is preserved. This work owns EQ and Studio; the DAW is maintained in its separate chat. Published 1.1.0 assets remain unchanged; no new release is authorized by this continuation.

## Baseline and source review

The independent localization-guard handoff reported 30/318 translated strings in EQ and 30/397 in Studio for each of 32 target locales. It checked catalogs, not completeness of source extraction or compiled/live views.

Review found missing equipment dialog titles/actions, validation reasons, microphone connection text, operational error messages and Studio render messages. These now enter the catalogs. Complete messages replace concatenated prompt/conflict/version fragments. Qt standard action captions share the embedded translation catalog. Raw external backend diagnostics and OS-native dialog text may retain their original language.

The review also fixed two functional bugs: source/conditions length limits depended on translated labels, and equipment-kind filtering used display text as a schema value. Limits are now explicit and selectors retain stable speaker/microphone/amplifier data. Brand/family/model names and user-supplied profile content remain literal. SDK/DSP implementation and driver sources were not modified.

## Current checkpoint

- Populated catalogs: de, fr, es, it, pt-PT, pt-BR, nl, pl, cs, sk, uk, ru, el, tr, sv, da, nb, fi, ro, hu, nn, ar, he, fa, zh-Hans, zh-Hant, ja, ko, hi, id, vi, th, sw; 547 extracted messages each. These are unverified translations; nativeReviewed remains false.
- All original target locales and added Nynorsk have populated current catalogs; omitted application messages still require the second pass. Exact counts and compiled hashes are authoritative in data/localization/catalogs.json.
- Coverage is distinct from contextual AI review, native-speaker verification and runtime qualification. Checkpoint reports in tests/results/localization identify tested catalogs, platforms and scopes.
- Runtime supports separate UI language and number/date locale selection, regional/script fallback, pseudo localization and RTL. Maintenance preserves unfinished edits/comments and rejects unsupported numerus before rewriting.
- Shared interface layout now wraps meter guidance; the curve instruction also wraps for longer translated text.

## Completion criteria

Populate all current messages for every existing locale, pass structural and compiled/live UI checks on Linux/Windows, validate changed packages, and record evidence/known limitations. Full populated coverage must never be labeled native-speaker verification without an identified reviewer and catalog-specific evidence. The global --require-complete gate passes for the current catalogs; this does not prove that every application-owned message has been extracted. No arbitrary English copies should be inserted merely to pass coverage.

Next work: second-pass inventory and localization of omitted application-owned messages. French, German, Spanish and Italian are required to stay populated as sources evolve. The Filter Q caption now describes the dimensionless filter quality parameter; saved processing IDs and numeric values are unchanged.

Windows audio setup now translates application-owned failure, repair, calibration and restart instructions. Restart-required results always retain the translated reboot instruction alongside original helper diagnostics. The source guard also rejects unmarked literal messages passed to the setup completion helper.

Spanish: all 523 extracted messages populated. Contextual AI review covers calibration safety, flat gain, low-volume loudness compensation, dry/wet mixing, compressor timing, routing and filter Q. Native-speaker verification remains unverified. Spanish equipment import/edit/save workflows and inert Windows setup-message fixtures are included in the test gates.

Italian: all 523 extracted messages populated. Full Linux CTest passed 53/53, including Italian equipment workflows. Settings/effects tabs inspected with xcb/Xvfb at 1280×720. Contextual AI review remains unverified; Windows qualification for the new catalogs is pending.

Portuguese partial checkpoint: 237/523 messages populated for each regional variant. Linux compiled-catalog and both Portuguese main-window checks passed (3/3). Regional terminology is reviewed separately; the remainder stays unfinished and falls back to English. Native-speaker verification remains unverified.

Portuguese completed checkpoint: all 523 extracted messages populated in both regional catalogs. Full Linux CTest passed 55/55, including both equipment workflows. Regional settings/effects tabs inspected at 1280×720. Structural completeness is required for future updates; all translations remain unverified. Prior Italian commits passed Windows CI.

Dutch: all 523 extracted messages populated. Full Linux CTest passed 56/56 before the meter-help wrapping adjustment. The localized equipment import/edit/save workflow is included. Meter-help text now wraps instead of forcing a wider EQ page. Contextual review remains unverified; current Windows qualification pending.

Layout follow-up: four targeted Dutch/Spanish/pseudo-locale checks passed after wrapping the meter-help label. Inspected Dutch EQ/Studio and Spanish EQ screenshots at 1280×720. The EQ page no longer needs page-wide horizontal scrolling in these samples; the frequency-band strip keeps its own scroll control. Prior Portuguese commits passed Windows CI.

Polish: all 523 extracted messages populated. Full Linux CTest passed 57/57 before one final plot-caption wording correction; focused runtime/UI/equipment tests cover the final catalog separately. Contextual review distinguishes signed gain, filter Q, flat response, low-volume loudness correction and count-independent render summaries. Native-speaker verification remains unverified; current Windows qualification pending.

Polish final catalog: three focused runtime/main-window/equipment checks passed. After curve-instruction wrapping, three Polish/pseudo-locale checks passed. Small-screen inspection still shows Polish EQ horizontal scrolling and partially offscreen headroom; layout qualification remains incomplete. The user also requested optional startup at sign-in for both apps; implement this alongside localization, preserving mutual exclusion and leaving it disabled by default.

Startup option: implemented in Settings for both apps. One shared per-user registration chooses EQ or Studio. Background launch has a visible-window fallback when no tray is available. Linux full tests passed 58/58. Windows build/installer and actual sign-in qualification remain pending. See startup.md.

Translations remain unverified; Windows and visual qualification are pending. Omitted source strings remain scheduled for the second pass.

### Swahili existing catalog complete

All 527/527 current Swahili catalog entries are populated. Required-complete and regional fallback gates now include Swahili. Full Linux CTest passed 84/84, including profile workflows and all locale MainWindow offscreen checks. The global catalog completeness gate passes. Translations remain unverified; Windows and visual qualification are pending. Omitted source strings remain scheduled for the second pass.

### Second-pass source inventory

Added `scripts/localization_inventory.py` and its generated `tests/results/localization/source-inventory.json`. This read-only discovery aid scans literal C++ exceptions and selected view calls across all source files, NSIS candidates and Python diagnostics. Counts are candidates, not confirmed untranslated user messages. Dynamic/composed strings, shell/PowerShell helpers, native dialogs and data-driven names still require review. Current catalog completeness checks continue to pass.

Confirmed first adapter targets: missing Windows audio-route instructions, disconnected speakers, invalid equalizer/microphone settings; Studio also has live-layout and invalid Studio-setting messages. Translate at the Qt adapter/view boundary while preserving backend identifiers and numeric processing. Installer strings require their own language selection and catalog workflow. The existing full Linux 82/82 (EQ) and 84/84 (Studio) results predate this informational tooling change; no new runtime qualification is claimed.

### Second-pass Windows adapter errors in progress

Qt adapter errors now use translation markers; a regression guard rejects direct untranslated exception literals. Seven new EQ / nine new Studio source messages entered the catalogs, including bridge-start fallback errors. German and French translations have been supplied; other locales remain unfinished and fall back to English. The required-complete gate is intentionally failing until the new translations are filled. Seven catalog-maintenance regressions passed in each repository. No Windows runtime qualification or new full-suite pass is claimed.

Second-pass adapter translation checkpoint: German, French, Spanish, Italian, European/Brazilian Portuguese, Dutch and Polish now populate all newly exposed adapter messages. Structural checks passed for these eight locales; seven catalog-maintenance regression tests passed in each repository. Other locales still need the seven EQ / nine Studio new messages, so the global completeness gate remains failing. Work remains local until that batch is complete; translations remain unverified.

Second-pass adapter translation checkpoint: added Czech, Slovak, Ukrainian, Russian, Greek and Turkish. Fourteen locales now populate all newly exposed adapter messages and pass structural checks. Seven catalog-maintenance regressions passed in each repository. The other nineteen non-English locales still need these messages, so the global completeness gate remains failing. Changes remain local; runtime qualification for this batch is pending and translations are unverified.

Second-pass adapter translation checkpoint: added Swedish, Danish, Norwegian Bokmål/Nynorsk, Finnish, Romanian and Hungarian. Twenty-one locales now populate all newly exposed adapter messages and pass structural checks. Seven catalog-maintenance regressions passed in each repository. Twelve non-English locales still need these messages; the global completeness gate remains failing. Work remains local, translations unverified and runtime qualification pending.

Second-pass adapter translation checkpoint: added Arabic, Hebrew, Persian, Simplified/Traditional Chinese, Japanese and Korean. Twenty-eight locales now populate all newly exposed adapter messages and pass structural checks. Seven catalog-maintenance regressions passed in each repository. Hindi, Indonesian, Vietnamese, Thai and Swahili still need these messages; the global completeness gate remains failing. Work remains local, translations unverified and runtime qualification pending.

### Second-pass Qt Windows adapter messages complete

All 33 non-English locales now cover the new seven EQ / nine Studio messages. Global required-complete and structural checks pass. Both apps rebuilt and passed two focused Linux checks; compiled message loading and Unicode exception round-trip run across non-English locales. The adapter rejects unmarked literal exception messages in source regression checks. Backend diagnostics and installers remain separate second-pass work. Translations are unverified; Windows/device/installer qualification is pending. Earlier in-progress checkpoints describe historical states.

### Backend diagnostic translation boundary

Added a shared Qt desktop-only audio-error mapper. The invariant Windows backend diagnostic “The selected EQ settings are invalid” now displays the existing translated equalizer-settings message. Unknown driver diagnostics retain their exact text and Unicode details. The backend remains Qt-independent and its diagnostics/processing identifiers are unchanged. Both builds passed catalog completeness and two focused Linux checks, including mapping across non-English locales. Other backend diagnostics still require cataloging; Windows runtime and package qualification remain pending.

### Backend literal diagnostics in progress

Extended the Qt desktop boundary to direct literal Windows audio/capture errors, including unsupported formats, buffer overrun and stalled microphone consumption. Each app adds eleven applicable catalog messages; backend diagnostic IDs and DSP code remain unchanged. Microphone and calibration display paths now use the same mapping. German/French translations pass structural checks; seven catalog-maintenance regressions pass. Remaining locales, HRESULT/composed diagnostics and runtime/package qualification remain incomplete. The global completeness gate is failing for the new untranslated entries. Changes remain local and translations unverified.

Backend literal translation checkpoint: added Spanish, Italian, European/Brazilian Portuguese, Dutch and Polish. Eight locales now populate all applicable new backend literal messages; structural checks and seven catalog-maintenance regressions passed. Twenty-five non-English locales remain. Changes remain local; no runtime qualification is claimed and translations remain unverified.

Backend literal translation checkpoint: added Czech, Slovak, Ukrainian, Russian, Greek and Turkish. Fourteen locales now populate the applicable new backend messages. Structural checks and seven catalog-maintenance regressions passed in each repository. Nineteen locales remain. Changes remain local, translations unverified and runtime qualification pending.

Backend literal translation checkpoint: added Swedish, Danish, Norwegian Bokmål/Nynorsk, Finnish, Romanian and Hungarian. Twenty-one locales populate all applicable new backend messages. Structural checks and seven catalog-maintenance regressions passed in each repository. Twelve locales remain; changes are local and translations unverified. Runtime/package qualification remains pending.

Backend literal translation checkpoint: added Arabic, Hebrew, Persian, both Chinese variants, Japanese and Korean. Twenty-eight locales populate the applicable new messages. Structural checks and seven catalog-maintenance regressions passed in each repository. Hindi, Indonesian, Vietnamese, Thai and Swahili remain. Changes are local, translations unverified and runtime/package qualification pending.

### Backend literal diagnostic batch complete

All 33 non-English locales now cover the eleven applicable direct-literal backend messages per app. Global required-complete and structural checks pass. Both apps rebuilt and passed two focused Linux checks, including compiled translations, known diagnostic mapping and preservation of unknown Unicode details. Backend/DSP sources remain unchanged. HRESULT/composed diagnostics, helper and installer messages, visual and Windows/package qualification remain outstanding. Translations remain unverified. Earlier in-progress checkpoints describe historical states.

### Composed Windows operation diagnostics in progress

The desktop mapper recognizes known backend check/checked operation captions and the exact HRESULT failure shape, translating the operation and message template while retaining the code. A compiled Qt fixture passed for both headers with a translated action/template, mixed-case code preservation and unknown/malformed fallback. Added the fixture as a CTest target. New operation captions (61 EQ / 63 Studio) and one failure template require translation; completeness is currently failing. Backend processing sources remain unchanged. Work remains local; no Windows runtime qualification is claimed.

HRESULT operation translation checkpoint: German and French now cover all applicable operation captions and the failure template. Current catalogs passed structural validation. The saved backend-error-text CTest fixture passed in both Linux builds with a synthetic translator; it checks exact error-code preservation and unknown/malformed fallback. Thirty-one locales remain; changes are local and translations unverified.

HRESULT operation translation checkpoint: added Spanish and Italian. Four current locale catalogs are structurally valid and complete; failure templates preserve placeholders and error codes. Spanish uses a neutral failure label that also fits noun-style diagnostics. Seven maintenance regressions and the synthetic-translator backend-error-text fixture passed in each repository. Twenty-nine locales remain; changes are local and translations unverified.

HRESULT operation checkpoint: European/Brazilian Portuguese and Dutch added. Seven current catalogs are structurally valid and complete. Portuguese terminology distinguishes colunas/alto-falantes, controlo/controle and mistura/mixagem. Seven maintenance regressions and the synthetic error-code fixture passed before the Dutch addition; Dutch additionally passed structural validation. Twenty-six locales remain. Changes are local and translations unverified.

HRESULT operation checkpoint: Polish and Czech added. Nine current catalogs are structurally valid and complete, with the neutral failure template preserving placeholder/error-code details. Seven maintenance regressions and the synthetic error-code fixture passed in each repository. Twenty-four locales remain. Changes are local and translations unverified.

HRESULT operation checkpoint: Slovak, Ukrainian and Russian added. Twelve current catalogs are structurally valid and complete. Russian distinguishes buffer fill from signal level and captured samples from packets. Seven maintenance regressions and the synthetic error-code fixture passed in each repository. Twenty-one locales remain. Changes are local and translations unverified; compiled catalog UI and Windows qualification remain pending.

HRESULT operation checkpoint: Greek added. Thirteen current catalogs are structurally valid and complete. The playback-padding caption describes buffered frames, while the output-buffer caption describes buffer fill rather than signal amplitude. Seven maintenance regressions and the synthetic error-code fixture passed in each repository. Twenty locales remain; translations are unverified and actual compiled-catalog UI/Windows qualification remains pending.

HRESULT operation checkpoint: Turkish added. Fourteen current catalogs are structurally valid and complete. Initialization captions describe preparation, distinct from starting streams; buffer-fill captions remain distinct from audio levels. Seven maintenance regressions and the synthetic error-code fixture passed in each repository. Nineteen locales remain. Changes are local and translations unverified; actual catalog UI and Windows qualification remain pending.

HRESULT operation checkpoint: Swedish added. Fifteen current catalogs are structurally valid and complete. Buffer fill, buffered audio frames, sample values and signal level use distinct captions. Seven maintenance regressions and the synthetic error-code fixture passed in each repository. Eighteen locales remain. Changes are local and translations unverified; actual catalog UI and Windows qualification remain pending.

Two locales remain. Changes are local and translations unverified; actual catalog UI and Windows qualification remain pending.

HRESULT operation checkpoint: Thai added. Thirty-two current catalogs are structurally valid and complete. Preparation and startup, buffer usage and signal level use distinct captions. Seven maintenance regressions and the synthetic error-code fixture passed in each repository. Swahili remains. Changes are local and translations unverified; actual catalog UI and Windows qualification remain pending.

HRESULT operation catalog batch complete: Swahili added. All 33 non-English locales now cover the known operation captions and failure template. Global required-complete/structural/compiled-hash checks pass: 611 extracted source messages across 34 catalogs. Seven maintenance regressions and the synthetic error-code fixture passed in each repository. Translations remain unverified; rebuilt application tests, actual catalog UI and Windows/package qualification remain pending. Omitted interface messages still require the second-pass audit.

HRESULT batch Linux qualification: rebuilt application and localization test; full CTest suite 85/85 passed. Added actual embedded-catalog tests for four operation captions and composed failures in every non-English locale, preserving mixed-case hexadecimal codes. This does not prove native-speaker accuracy, visual rendering or Windows installation behavior.

Second-pass reachability audit: two additional Windows messages are outside current extracted catalogs: the conditional microphone-start timeout and composed cable-format rejection. Their fixed producer strings and call sites were inspected; desktop mappings/catalog entries are still needed. Backend processing sources remain unchanged. See backend-composed-gaps.json; this is not a complete interface audit.

Second-pass composed diagnostic fix: mapped microphone startup timeout and cable format rejection at the desktop boundary and translated both across all 33 non-English catalogs. Global required-complete and structural checks plus seven maintenance regressions pass. Added these to actual compiled-catalog mapping tests; rebuild/runtime execution remains pending. Backend sources unchanged; translations unverified.

Second-pass composed diagnostic qualification: rebuilt localization-test and passed four focused Linux CTests in each repository. Actual embedded catalogs mapped the two added diagnostics in every non-English locale without English fallback. Visual/UI and Windows/package qualification remain pending; nativeReviewed remains false.

Second-pass inventory refresh: current source counts reflected; test-fixture errors and invariant branding distinguished from production text. A production recovery-helper startup failure in windows_managed_route.h is not yet translated. Studio additionally has PipeWire live-engine errors requiring reachability review. Inventory remains partial and is not proof of whole-interface coverage.

Recovery-helper diagnostic fix: desktop mapping added, translated in all 33 non-English locales and tested using actual compiled catalogs. Three focused Linux CTests passed in each app, including catalog completeness and maintenance regressions. Recovery-helper control flow/backend sources unchanged. Translations remain unverified; visual and Windows/package qualification pending.

Second-pass Studio Linux live-audio audit: six fixed diagnostics from linux_audio.cpp propagate through desktop start/update and are outside current catalogs. Channel-limit advice, routing validation, PipeWire loop/stream creation and connection failures, and live-layout advice need desktop mappings/translations. Backend remains Qt-independent; engine.configure rejection messages still require a separate audit.

Studio live diagnostic batch started: six desktop mappings added; German current catalog structurally complete. Two direct StudioPanel error-status paths bypassed the desktop mapper and now use audioErrorText with explicit UTF-8 conversion. Other 32 non-English locales need the new entries; global completeness is temporarily failing. Runtime/UI tests pending; backend processing unchanged.

Studio live diagnostic checkpoint: French and Spanish added for all six known errors. Three current locale catalogs are structurally complete; thirty locales remain. Placeholder/numeric checks passed; global completeness is still failing. Translations unverified; compiled runtime and UI qualification pending.

Studio live diagnostic checkpoint: Italian and European/Brazilian Portuguese added. Six current locale catalogs are structurally complete; twenty-seven remain. Portuguese distinguishes encaminhamento/roteamento, ligar/conectar and ciclo/loop. Global completeness is still failing; translations unverified and compiled runtime/UI qualification pending.

Studio live diagnostic checkpoint: Dutch, Polish and Czech added. Nine current locale catalogs are structurally complete; twenty-four remain. Channel limits and advice to stop playback before live layout changes retained. Global completeness is still failing; translations unverified and compiled runtime/UI qualification pending.

Studio live diagnostic checkpoint: Slovak, Ukrainian and Russian added. Twelve current locale catalogs are structurally complete; twenty-one remain. Ukrainian/Russian describe real-time processing explicitly; channel limits and stop-playback advice retained. Global completeness is still failing; translations unverified and compiled runtime/UI qualification pending.

Studio live diagnostic checkpoint: Greek, Turkish and Swedish added. Fifteen current locale catalogs are structurally complete; eighteen remain. Real-time processing versus offline rendering, channel limits and stop-playback advice retained. Global completeness is still failing; translations unverified and compiled runtime/UI qualification pending.

Studio live diagnostic checkpoint: Danish, Norwegian Bokmål and Finnish added. Eighteen current locale catalogs are structurally complete; fifteen remain. Real-time processing versus offline rendering, channel limits and stop-playback advice retained. Global completeness is still failing; translations unverified and compiled runtime/UI qualification pending.

Studio live diagnostic checkpoint: Romanian, Hungarian and Nynorsk added in the requested order. Twenty-one current locale catalogs are structurally complete; twelve remain. Real-time processing versus offline rendering, channel limits and stop-playback advice retained. Global completeness is still failing; translations unverified and compiled runtime/UI qualification pending.

Studio live diagnostic checkpoint: Arabic, Hebrew and Persian added. Twenty-four current locale catalogs are structurally complete; nine remain. Offline rendering is described as non-real-time rendering; channel limits and stop-playback advice retained. Global completeness is still failing; translations unverified. Mixed-direction rendering and compiled runtime/UI qualification pending.

Studio live diagnostic checkpoint: Simplified/Traditional Chinese and Japanese added. Twenty-seven current locale catalogs are structurally complete; six remain. Chinese regional terms distinguish 实时流/即時串流 and 声道布局/聲道配置. Channel limits and stop-playback advice retained. Global completeness is still failing; translations unverified and compiled runtime/UI qualification pending.

Studio live diagnostic checkpoint: Korean, Hindi and Indonesian added. Thirty current locale catalogs are structurally complete; three remain. Real-time processing versus offline rendering, channel limits and stop-playback advice retained. Global completeness is still failing; translations unverified and compiled runtime/UI qualification pending.

Studio live diagnostic catalog batch complete: Vietnamese, Thai and Swahili added. All 33 current non-English catalogs are structurally complete. Channel limits and stop-playback advice retained. Translations unverified; compiled runtime/UI qualification pending. Engine rejection strings, helper/installer gaps and visual/Windows qualification remain outside this batch.

Studio live diagnostic qualification: app and tests rebuilt; four focused Linux tests passed. Actual embedded catalogs mapped all six live errors in every non-English locale without English fallback. Panel exception paths compiled with the desktop mapper. Visual panel error display, Windows/package and other engine/helper/installer gaps remain pending. Translations remain unverified.

Second-pass engine/panel audit: nine engine configure rejection messages and three direct live-status literals inspected and recorded in studio-engine-message-gaps.json. StudioPanel load/preview/render exception detail now uses the desktop mapper with explicit UTF-8 conversion. Engine messages and live statuses still need catalog mappings/translations; panel rebuild and runtime verification pending. Backend engine unchanged.

Studio engine/status batch started: desktop mappings for nine engine validation errors and SC_TR markers for three live-status branches added. German current catalog structurally complete; 32 non-English locales need these entries. Original engine diagnostics/processing numbers remain unchanged. Global completeness temporarily failing; translations unverified and runtime/UI qualification pending.

Studio engine/status checkpoint: French and Spanish added. Three current locale catalogs structurally complete; thirty remain. Finite gain/range constraints, 128 MiB state budget and live/offline status meanings retained. Global completeness still failing; translations unverified and runtime/UI tests pending.

Studio engine/status checkpoint: Italian and European/Brazilian Portuguese added. Six current locale catalogs structurally complete; twenty-seven remain.

Studio engine/status checkpoint: Greek, Turkish and Swedish added. Fifteen current locale catalogs structurally complete; eighteen remain. Finite gain/range constraints, 128 MiB state budget and live/offline status meanings retained. Global completeness still failing; translations unverified and runtime/UI tests pending.

Studio engine/status checkpoint: Danish, Norwegian Bokmål and Finnish added. Eighteen current locale catalogs structurally complete; fifteen remain. Finite gain/range constraints, 128 MiB state budget and live/offline status meanings retained. Global completeness still failing; translations unverified and runtime/UI tests pending.

Studio engine/status checkpoint: Romanian, Hungarian and Nynorsk added. Twenty-one current locale catalogs structurally complete; twelve remain. Finite gain/range constraints, 128 MiB state budget and live/offline status meanings retained. Global completeness still failing; translations unverified and runtime/UI tests pending.

Studio engine/status checkpoint: Arabic, Hebrew and Persian added. Twenty-four current locale catalogs structurally complete; nine remain. Finite gain/range constraints, 128 MiB state budget and live/offline status meanings retained. Global completeness still failing; translations unverified. Mixed-direction rendering and runtime/UI tests pending.

Studio engine/status checkpoint: Simplified/Traditional Chinese and Japanese added. Twenty-seven current locale catalogs structurally complete; six remain. Finite gain/range constraints, 128 MiB state budget and live/offline status meanings retained. Global completeness still failing; translations unverified and runtime/UI tests pending.

Studio engine/status checkpoint: Korean, Hindi and Indonesian added. Thirty current locale catalogs structurally complete; three remain. Finite gain/range constraints, 128 MiB state budget and live/offline status meanings retained. Global completeness still failing; translations unverified and runtime/UI tests pending.

Studio engine/status catalog batch complete: Vietnamese, Thai and Swahili added. All 33 current non-English catalogs structurally complete. Finite gain/range constraints, 128 MiB state budget and live/offline status meanings retained. Translations unverified; runtime/UI tests pending. This batch does not complete the remaining session/WAVE/helper/installer audit or Windows/package qualification.

Studio engine/status Linux qualification: rebuilt app, panel and tests. Six focused CTests passed, including actual embedded engine-error translations and live-status coverage across every non-English locale, plus automated German/Arabic UI fixtures. These are not visual/native-speaker or Windows/package qualification. Engine sources/processing unchanged; translations unverified.

First-pass requalification (2026-10-08): all 85 existing Linux CTests passed, including compiled-catalog, maintenance and automated locale UI fixtures. Current extracted catalogs are populated in all 33 non-English locales. Missing interface strings deferred to the requested second pass. This run uses existing build binaries and does not certify full rebuild provenance, visual usability, native linguistic accuracy, Windows or package lifecycle. See first-pass-requalification.json.

First-pass visual evidence (2026-10-08): current application rebuilt and 1280×720 Xvfb screenshots inspected. Polish Equalizer page clips the headroom label and requires outer horizontal scrolling; visual qualification fails for that layout. Studio Arabic text is present, while mixed-direction headroom and scrolling still need review. Screenshots/report saved under tests/results/localization/visual-first-pass. No native review, live audio or Windows/package qualification claimed. Missing interface text remains deferred.

Headroom layout correction (2026-10-08): placed the existing translated label on a separate wrapping row with UI text direction in both apps. Rebuilt and inspected Polish 1280×720 capture: full headroom text visible. Six focused Linux tests passed. Outer page horizontal scrolling persists; broader visual, RTL and Windows/package qualification remain incomplete. No catalog/source strings or DSP/settings changed.

Meter-row layout correction (2026-10-08): separated refresh/peak-marker controls and enabled peak-status wrapping. Both applications rebuilt; inspected Polish 1280×720 screenshots show the Equalizer group fitting the window with no outer horizontal scrollbar. The band strip retains its own independent scrolling. Six focused Linux tests passed per app. Other widths/locales and Windows/package qualification remain pending; DSP/settings unchanged.

Standalone-engine build regression corrected (2026-10-08): Windows/Linux CI found the desktop translation test linked Qt when SOUNDCURRENT_BUILD_DESKTOP=OFF. Guarded that Qt-only test with the desktop option. Fresh engine-only Release build and all six CTests passed; desktop backend translation test rebuilt and passed. Windows CI confirmation remains pending. No engine/driver processing changed.

Windows baseline qualification (2026-10-08): verified independent soundcurrent-win11-dev disk and SSH access. Preserved the prior Studio 1.0.0 installation/settings before silent per-user upgrade to CI baseline d285849. Installer SHA-256 verified; all 33 installed Windows offscreen locale fixtures loaded their expected catalogs and passed control checks. QT_FORCE_STDERR_LOGGING was needed to capture GUI process diagnostics; initial harness failure was missing log evidence. This is not current-candidate, visual, native or uninstall qualification. Engine-only CI fix also confirmed on Linux and Windows (run 37741018987). Current EQ artifact download started after its CI succeeded.

Windows layout candidate qualification (2026-10-08): verified installer SHA-256 from CI run 37741018825, upgraded the independent SoundCurrent VM installation, and passed all 33 installed offscreen locale/control fixtures. Silent in-place reinstall and uninstall passed: owned settings marker and unknown user file preserved; executable and uninstall registration removed; audio PnP identities/status unchanged. Reports saved as windows-installed-candidate.json and windows-candidate-lifecycle.json; opt-in lifecycle script shared by both apps. These checks do not establish native/visual review, interactive installer or driver lifecycle. Prior VM installation backups retained.

Native Windows rendering checkpoint (2026-10-08): both candidates successfully reinstalled after lifecycle tests. Qt windows-platform fixtures captured all tabs for German, Polish and Arabic; selected screenshots inspected and saved under tests/results/localization/windows-visual. Polish headroom/layout fits the captured window; German settings wrap; Arabic text and effects render. Arabic headroom number/unit order remains a known mixed-direction issue. SSH-launched widget captures do not establish signed-in interactive desktop, native-language, all-locale or HiDPI qualification. Shared capture harness added; current coverage paragraph corrected.

RTL headroom correction (2026-10-08): shared display helper places a signed numeric headroom value and invariant dB unit inside an LTR isolate, preserving the RTL sentence. Catalogs, stored parameters and DSP remain unchanged. Rebuilt apps/tests; six focused Linux tests passed per app. Actual Qt glyph positions verify sign/number/unit order in Arabic, Hebrew and Persian; inspected screenshots saved under rtl-headroom. Initial caret-position test was replaced because bidi boundary carets are ambiguous. Updated Windows package and other mixed-direction labels remain pending; native review unverified.

RTL regional-number regression checks (2026-10-08): use the actual accelerating numeric control and Runtime with ar-EG, he-IL and fa-IR formatting. Localized negative fractional gain parses as -12.5; displayed regional digits/decimal separator retained; JSON representation and Flat machine ID unchanged. Arabic UI with German decimal-comma format verifies independent selection. Rebuilt localization targets and passed localization CTest in both apps. No production code changed; new Windows execution, visual/native review and broader numeric/file workflows remain pending.

Peak/live-gain formatting correction (2026-10-08): live post-gain label now retains the selected regional decimal format when its slider moves. Peak/clipping captions and overall peak tooltip keep signed value and dBFS together in RTL prose and use QLocale formatting. Seven focused Linux tests passed per app, including actual post-gain movement under Arabic UI/German decimal formatting and rendered glyph checks for four messages across Arabic/Hebrew/Persian catalogs. Only display/test code changed; catalog strings, processing values and settings IDs unchanged. Windows updated-package and remaining mixed-direction fields still pending.

Ubuntu package qualification (2026-10-08): built current DEB preview, saved SHA-256 and tested on independent Ubuntu 26.04.1 QA VM. Upgrade from prior installed version, all 33 installed offscreen locale fixtures and live regional-format slider check passed. Same-version update, apt removal and reinstall preserved owned settings/profile fixtures and an unknown user file; installed UI passed after reinstall. Preview packages and fuller logs retained under Downloads/SoundCurrent-localization-qa/linux-f425218-94aad56; repository report/test scripts added. No host app/audio changes or release publication; RPM/interactive/native qualification pending.

Cross-Qt numeric regression investigation (2026-10-08): newest CI invalidates a broad pass claim. Ubuntu 24.04 fails the localized negative-gain assertion; Studio Windows fails localization without visible Qt error text. Host Qt 6.10.2 passes. Added controlled test diagnostics (Qt version, locale, input codepoints, parsed/control values) and forced stderr capture in Windows test stage. Rebuilt local localization tests pass; supported-version regression remains unresolved. RPM qualification deferred until this is understood; native review unverified.

Qt 6.4 input cause/workaround (2026-10-08): CI run 37743704588 identifies ar-EG formatted U+061C - Arabic digits/decimal; Qt 6.4.2 QLocale parser rejects its own string and numeric control stays at 1.5 rather than -12.5. Shared spin validation/conversion now removes only locale presentation marks U+061C/U+200E/U+200F, preserving sign/digits/separator and caret. Rebuilt applications and passed eight focused Linux tests per app; supported Qt 6.4/Windows confirmation pending. Windows test stderr is now retained/printed on failure. Refreshed localization-guard audit: 33 target catalogs, current counts 524 EQ / 632 Studio, zero structural findings; linguistic/runtime fields remain unknown. No native review or release claim.

### Windows font-backed RTL qualification

The numeric presentation-mark fix passed the EQ Linux CI job on Qt 6.4.2 (run 37744428560). Studio engine CI run 37744429998 passed. Windows run 37744430081 reported an unavailable offscreen font directory before failing glyph-position checks. The Windows localization test now uses the native Windows Qt backend and system fonts; its assertions remain intact. Fresh Windows CI confirmation is pending. Missing interface strings remain deferred to the second pass.

### Current package qualification (c0ae560)

Host Linux CTest passed 86/86. Updated Ubuntu 26.04 independent-VM packages passed all 33 installed language fixtures, mixed Arabic/German formatting, update/remove/reinstall and fixture preservation. Package CI run 37745019865 passed Ubuntu 24.04, Fedora 44 and AlmaLinux 10 container lifecycle checks. This does not establish native-speaker review or an actual RHEL desktop test. Windows CI passed; current installed Windows qualification is tracked separately. No release was published.

Current installed Windows Studio passed 33 native-backend locale fixtures, silent update/uninstall/reinstall, settings/user-file fixture preservation, unchanged audio device identity/status, and Arabic/German formatting after reinstall. Interactive installer and signed-in startup remain unqualified.

### Nynorsk Windows CI fixture coverage

The installed VM harness already exercised all 33 translated locales, including Nynorsk. The Windows build script omitted nn from its explicit UI fixture list; nn has now been added without changing catalogs or processing. Fresh CI verification is pending.

### Narrow high-scaling layout fix

Selected-band labels now sit above their frequency/gain/Q controls, and the preset selector sits above its action buttons. Arabic at an effective 960×540 display (Xvfb 1920×1080 at 200%) now reports outer horizontal range 0 in both apps. Both first-page screenshots were inspected; four focused UI/regional-format tests passed per app. This does not qualify lower scrolled controls, Windows or rebuilt packages. No processing, IDs, stored settings or catalog strings changed.

### All-locale first-page scaling measurement

At 200% scale on Xvfb 1920×1080 (effective 960×540), all 33 translated locale/control fixtures passed and every first-page outer horizontal scroll maximum was zero. Measurements are recorded in tests/results/localization/hidpi/all-locales.json. This is automated geometry evidence, not visual or native-speaker review, and does not qualify lower scrolled content or Windows display scaling. Current package CI remains pending.

### Scrolled high-scaling interface inspection

The localization fixture can optionally capture middle and bottom scroll positions with SOUNDCURRENT_UI_CAPTURE_SCROLL. Inspected lower-page results are recorded in tests/results/localization/hidpi/scrolled/report.json. Polish Studio settings still show horizontal overflow around calibration/update controls. Default English channel names are recorded for the deferred second pass; no saved names or IDs were modified. This evidence is partial visual inspection, not native review.

### Settings layout qualification

Calibration and update actions now use two rows; amplifier controls are stacked, and microphone tone controls use a two-column grid. All tabs reported horizontal range zero for all 33 translated locales at effective 960×540 (200% scaling). Russian amplifier/microphone and Polish calibration/update viewports were inspected and readable. Seven focused UI, formatting, update-policy and catalog tests passed per app. Tests/results/localization/hidpi/settings-fixed records exact worktree source hashes; Windows and rebuilt packages remain pending. Processing, IDs, state and translated catalogs were unchanged.

### Exact installed preview identity

APT can skip a local preview whose version equals the installed package. The independent-VM localization harness now forces reinstall and compares /usr/bin executables byte-for-byte with their package contents before testing. Both current application builds passed all 33 installed locale fixtures and mixed Arabic/German formatting. Update/remove/reinstall and preservation fixtures passed. These runs supersede earlier equal-version locale checks that did not establish current executable identity; their lifecycle reinstall evidence remains separately scoped. No processing or catalogs changed.

### Current Windows installed qualification

Both current application builds passed all 33 installed native-backend locale fixtures, installer/executable identity checks, update/uninstall/reinstall, fixture preservation, unchanged audio-device state, and Arabic/German formatting. Defender antivirus and real-time protection were enabled. Current Linux package CI passed full suites (84 EQ / 86 Studio) and lifecycle checks on Ubuntu, Fedora and AlmaLinux. A selected native Windows viewport per app was inspected; screenshots and exact source/package hashes are recorded separately. The older EQ detection remains unresolved; no exclusion or disabled protection was introduced. Native review, interactive installer and signed-in startup remain unqualified. No release published.

### Profile defaults and authored provenance

New profile names, relative-response import instructions and newly authored provenance captions now use the selected interface language. Existing saved or published metadata remains verbatim; opening a profile does not rewrite it. Filenames, SHA256 digests, profile IDs and processing data are unchanged. All 33 non-English catalogs contain the eight added captions. Compiled localization and French/Arabic/Nynorsk equipment-dialog fixtures passed locally; source guards passed in both applications. These checks do not prove native-speaker accuracy or every creation field visually. Fresh Windows and installed-package qualification remains pending.

### Confirmed Qt fallback file chooser gap

An isolated real Qt file-dialog probe loaded the actual French app catalog and shared standard-action translator. The fallback chooser still displayed English field labels, navigation tooltips and Open; Cancel was translated. This is an unresolved interface gap, separate from native operating-system dialog language. The exact probe and limitations are recorded in tests/results/localization/qt-file-dialog-gap.json. Next: cover file-dialog/file-model contexts and actual open/save/error workflows without altering paths or filter semantics.

### Basic Qt fallback chooser captions

Nine chooser field/navigation captions and existing Open/Save are now mapped only in QFileDialog context. Catalogs use installed Qt 6.10.2 translations for 24 non-English locales and contextual AI translations for nine locales; all remain native-unverified. Exact provenance is in qt-file-dialog-label-origins.json; upstream copyright and GPL-3.0/Qt-exception notice are retained in docs/licenses/qt-translations-copyright.txt. This addresses basic controls only. Accessibility descriptions, file-model headers, context menus and error dialogs remain pending. Actual fallback chooser tests check fields, tooltips, open/save captions, opaque Unicode filenames and file-filter preservation.

The expanded compiled Linux localization fixture passed in both apps (EQ 20.11 s; Studio 18.60 s). Its 60-second limit covers repeated real Qt chooser construction across 33 locales. It checks constructor/control state, not file acceptance, accessibility descriptions or error workflows. Windows and installed packages remain pending.

### Qt chooser accessibility captions

Nine accessibility captions now use the app catalog in QFileDialog context: navigation descriptions, sidebar name/description and file-view names. Qt upstream translations cover 24 non-English locales; nine locales use contextual AI translations. All remain native-unverified. Navigation refers to directory history and parent folders, not playback. Regional spot review checked pt-BR/pt-PT (Arquivos/Ficheiros, favoritos/marcadores), nb/nn (frem/fram, listevisning/listevising), Romanian/Hungarian and Arabic/Hebrew against these controls. This does not certify all upstream wording. Tests query actual QAccessible interfaces across 33 non-English locales; no screen-reader listening test is claimed. Context menus, model headers and error workflows remain pending.

### Qt 6.12 Windows chooser compatibility

Native Windows run 37892083899 failed the new basic chooser field assertion. Qt 6.12 upstream UI uses &Look in: and Files of &type:, where Linux Qt 6.4 uses the unmarked forms. The shared translator now maps both exact forms to existing captions; compiled tests explicitly check aliases and report actual/expected field values, locale and Qt version on mismatch. Fresh native Windows qualification is required; the preceding Linux pass does not establish it.

### Qt chooser file actions and headers

Exact QFileDialog context mappings now cover Rename, Delete, New Folder and Show Hidden Files. Exact QFileSystemModel mappings cover Name, Size, Type and Date Modified headers. Studio retains its existing Name catalog entries. Names and paths in model rows are opaque data. These captions describe filesystem operations; they do not rename equipment or change audio processing. Added translations retain upstream provenance and native-unverified status. Actual chooser action/header tests run in each non-English locale. Header visibility menu composition, file-type/size values and errors/confirmation workflows remain pending. No rename/delete/new-folder operation is executed by the tests.

### Generic Qt file-type captions and formatting gap

QAbstractFileIconProvider now maps Drive, File, Folder, Shortcut and Unknown in its exact context; Windows File Folder maps to Folder. All five captions use contextual AI translations, native-unverified. Folder refers to a filesystem directory; Shortcut means a filesystem link, not a keyboard shortcut. Actual generic-provider checks cover directory, drive and unknown paths; direct context checks cover the remaining tokens and Windows folder alias. MIME database comments and Windows file-association descriptions are not covered. Qt 6.4 upstream QFileSystemModelPrivate::size/time explicitly use QLocale::system(), so the app's selected format locale is not honored there. This is recorded as an unresolved formatting gap, not waived by the native-dialog exception.
