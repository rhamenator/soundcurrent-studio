# SoundCurrent Studio

Private C++ audio development starting from the SoundCurrent EQ 0.7.0 shared
Linux/Windows application. The aim is a reusable processing library for
arbitrary channel layouts, effects, and a separate digital audio workstation suite.

The **Studio engine 0.1** milestone provides a C++20 library for 1–256 logical
channels, independent channel EQ, explicit routing matrices, feedback delay and
algorithmic reverb. An offline WAVE renderer exercises multichannel processing
without a surround sound device. The library builds without Qt and can be reused
by a separate DAW through its exported CMake package.

The inherited desktop app still uses its stereo processing path. Connecting the
new engine to live Linux/Windows device routing and adding Studio effect controls
are the next development steps; this milestone is an engine preview.

The complete source history and tags were imported from
[SoundCurrent EQ](https://github.com/rhamenator/soundcurrent-eq).
`main` starts from the current shared application; `public-main` preserves the
original public default branch and `windows-port` preserves the imported development branch.
Existing GPL-3.0-only licensing and third-party notices are included.

## Studio engine quick start

Use a C++20 compiler and CMake 3.20 or newer. Python 3 enables the WAVE file tests.
No audio device, Qt installation or virtual audio driver is needed:

```bash
cmake -S . -B build-engine -DSOUNDCURRENT_BUILD_DESKTOP=OFF -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build-engine --config Release --parallel 2
ctest --test-dir build-engine -C Release --output-on-failure
cmake --install build-engine --config Release --prefix "$PWD/engine-sdk"
```

On Windows, use a Visual Studio 2022 developer terminal. The renderer is in
`build-engine/Release/`; on Linux it is in `build-engine/`.
For example, render a new file with delay and reverb:

```bash
build-engine/soundcurrent-studio-render --input music.wav --output music-effects.wav \
  --delay-ms 250 --delay-feedback 0.3 --delay-mix 0.15 \
  --reverb-decay 1.5 --reverb-mix 0.12 --tail 3
```

Existing output files are never overwritten. CI builds and tests the standalone
engine on Linux and native Windows, and provides SDK artifacts in this private
repository. See [engine usage, routing and limits](docs/studio-engine.md) and the
[independent C++ consumer](examples/engine_consumer) for integration details.

## Equalizer baseline

SoundCurrent EQ is a native C++ desktop equalizer for Linux and Windows. It
gives every app that plays through the default output the same adjustable sound
profile. Both versions open with **Flat** selected and offer 34 listening
presets, post gain, stereo balance, and background operation. Both versions offer 5 to 31 bands with editable gain, center frequency and
width (Q), saved custom profiles, colored per-band FFT meters, configurable
refresh and peak markers, microphone tone controls, and speaker/room
measurement with a preview before applying changes. Windows microphone EQ
uses a separate second virtual cable so speaker processing can keep running.
The shared interface also offers 18 measured speaker-model profiles and
imported amplifier correction profiles. Hardware workflows are tested
separately from the shared UI and DSP. See the testing notes for coverage.

## How listening works

When the equalizer is on, SoundCurrent EQ creates a PipeWire filter. On current
WirePlumber systems, audio to the selected physical output passes through the
filter while that output remains the system default. The system volume then
applies once, at the physical output. On older WirePlumber systems, the app uses
a virtual default output and keeps its volume in sync with the physical output
so the two do not reduce the signal twice. Audio passes through automatic
headroom, the adjustable EQ bands, post gain, and left/right balance. The
**Automatic** device setting follows newly connected outputs, while the dropdown
lets you pin a specific device.

The EQ curve shows what the frequency settings do. Colored indicators next to
the sliders show a live estimate of the sound level near each frequency. The
**Overall output** bar shows the estimated peak after post gain and balance;
teal, amber, and red show increasing clipping risk. Set **Level refresh** from
1 to 100 ms (16 ms by default), and turn on **Peak
markers** to see a falling peak hold line on each indicator, including the
overall bar. Peak markers start off; both choices are remembered. The timer
uses precise scheduling, but
actual display updates depend on when the audio backend supplies new audio. Very short
intervals use more CPU. The peak readout turns amber or red as the estimated
output approaches clipping.
Boosting bands can lower overall loudness because the app makes room for those
boosts; **Post gain** lets you bring the level back up. Its slider runs from
-12 to +12 dB in 0.5 dB steps, starts at 0 dB, and remembers your adjustment.
The **Balance** slider moves toward L or R by reducing the opposite channel.
Center preserves both channels at full level, and either end mutes the opposite
channel. It also remembers your setting. The indicators are estimates, so listen
for audible distortion as well as watching the display.

Click the framed **Equalizer on/off** control to compare with normal audio.
Closing the window keeps the EQ running in the background. **Quit app** unloads
it and restores the normal output. Linux uses PipeWire filters; Windows uses the shared C++ DSP through WASAPI.

## Install

Download the package for your system from the [latest release](https://github.com/rhamenator/soundcurrent-eq/releases/latest).

### Windows 10 and 11 (64-bit)

Download the [0.7.0 shared-interface preview](https://github.com/rhamenator/soundcurrent-eq/releases/tag/parity-preview-0.7.0)
for the current Windows installer and matching Ubuntu, Fedora and RHEL-compatible packages.
The Windows build is a preview using the same interface and controls as
Linux. The installer bundles Qt and the C++ runtime; users do not need to
install a development environment.

The Windows installer installs the app for your user and adds shortcuts to
the Start menu and desktop. The first Windows
release uses WASAPI shared audio and the signed [VB-CABLE virtual audio driver](https://vb-audio.com/Cable/)
to route system playback through the equalizer. Setup includes the unmodified
standard driver package and offers to install it if it is missing. The driver
step requires administrator approval; the equalizer itself runs as your user.

1. Run `SoundCurrent-EQ-<version>-windows-x64-setup.exe`. Leave **Install the
   standard VB-CABLE driver** checked if the driver is missing. Approve
   Windows' administrator prompt, then click **Install Driver** in VB-Audio's
   setup. An existing standard VB-CABLE installation is detected and skipped.
2. Restart Windows after installing the driver. If you skipped or cancelled
   that step, retry using **Install VB-CABLE** in the SoundCurrent EQ Start
   menu folder or **Audio driver setup** in the app. Silent app installations
   do not install or elevate the driver.
3. Launch SoundCurrent EQ. It routes default playback through the standard
   cable while processing audio to the selected physical speakers or headphones.
   The **Automatic** output choice follows newly connected output devices;
   choose a named output to pin it.
4. Click the framed **Equalizer on/off** control to compare with normal playback.
   **Quit app** restores the default output and unloads the EQ. Closing the
   window keeps processing in the notification area. Later changes you make
   to Windows defaults are preserved when quitting.
5. For simultaneous microphone EQ, install a separate second signed cable
   yourself, such as VB-CABLE A/B. These paid packages are not bundled. Select
   its input in **Microphone cable**; recording applications use the matching
   cable output, which the app selects as the default recording endpoint while
   microphone EQ is enabled. The standard playback cable cannot be reused for
   microphone processing. Disable mic EQ or quit to restore the physical mic.

The equalizer works with stereo playback. The Windows build currently uses
the Windows shared-mode audio path and adapts to the selected endpoint's mix
format and sample rate. Select the Windows default output after setup;
VB-Audio's installer may change playback and recording defaults, so also
check your preferred microphone. VB-CABLE is separate third-party software,
with its own [license and donation terms](https://vb-audio.com/Services/licensing.htm).
If useful, donate/pay for a license; professional deployments may require
paid licenses. The bundled archive retains the vendor's original readme and
license. Uninstalling the EQ keeps this shared driver installed.

For source builds, use Windows with Visual Studio 2022 C++ tools, CMake,
7-Zip, and NSIS. In PowerShell, run:

```powershell
./scripts/install-windows-qt.ps1
./scripts/build-windows.ps1 -QtPrefix C:\Qt\6.12.0\msvc2022_64
```

SDK, source and driver archives are fetched from their official HTTPS hosts
and checked against pinned SHA-256 values. The driver setup's Windows
signature is checked before requesting elevation. Setup works offline when
Windows can validate the signature. The app installer, Qt corresponding source,
and checksum files are written to `dist/`.

For the Windows integration checks, see [Windows testing](docs/windows-testing.md).

### Ubuntu 24.04 and newer

1. Open the `.deb` in Ubuntu's package installer, or run:

   ```bash
   sudo apt install ./soundcurrent-eq_*.deb
   ```

2. Launch **SoundCurrent EQ** from the app menu. The equalizer starts on using
   the current output device. Choose **Automatic** or a specific output device.

The package declares its dependencies so `apt` installs the required Qt and
PipeWire tools. The Ubuntu package targets 64-bit Ubuntu 24.04 LTS and newer
with PipeWire audio.

### Fedora 44 and RHEL 10

Choose the `.fc44.x86_64.rpm` file for Fedora 44, or the `.el10.x86_64.rpm`
file for RHEL 10. Install it with the desktop package manager or run:

```bash
sudo dnf install ./soundcurrent-eq-*.rpm
```

The RHEL 10 package is built in AlmaLinux 10, which targets RHEL 10 binary
compatibility. It has been checked for package dependency resolution and the
Qt interface in that environment; the live audio test still requires a desktop
PipeWire session. RHEL 9 is not a target for this package.

Each package has a `.sha256` checksum file. Download it alongside the package
and run `sha256sum -c <package-name>.sha256` before installing.

For a user-only install when the runtime dependencies are already present:

```bash
./scripts/install-user.sh ./soundcurrent-eq_*.deb
```

This extracts the package under `~/.local/share/soundcurrent-eq` and creates a
launcher in `~/.local/share/applications`. It does not use administrator access
or install missing dependencies.

## Speaker and amplifier profiles

**Speaker model correction** is an independent layer added to the listening
preset and manual bands. Selecting **Flat** resets the listening bands;
selecting **None** removes the model correction. You can add **Bass Boost**,
**Loudness**, or your own low-frequency adjustments after choosing a model.
Speaker and amplifier selections participate in Undo and Lock EQ. The curve
and automatic headroom reflect the complete set of filters.

The offline catalog includes JBL 305P/306P/308P Mark II, Kali LP-6v2/LP-8v2,
ADAM T5V/T7V, Yamaha HS5/HS7/HS8, Edifier MR4, KRK RoKit 5 G4, KEF Q150/Q350,
ELAC Debut 2.0 B6.2 and Debut Reference DBR-62, Wharfedale Diamond 12.1, and
the **original Sony SS-CS5**. The Sony entry explicitly excludes **SS-CS5M2**:
no unverified substitute curve is supplied for that newer model.

These are conservative adaptations of [Spinorama AutoEQ](https://github.com/pierreaubert/spinorama)
with attribution to the original measurements. Positive filters below 80 Hz
are omitted, individual gains are capped at ±6 dB, and Q is capped at 6.
**Profile details** shows the applied filters and source links. They correct
published model response, without assuming the same room, positioning,
amplifier, unit variation, or microphone response as the original measurement.
Source files, provenance and exact upstream revision are in `data/speakers/`.

### Imported amplifier measurements

**Amplifier / receiver** defaults to None. No amplifier response is inferred
from a marketing frequency range. In particular, the Pyle PDA29BU specification
of 20 Hz–20 kHz is not a numerical correction curve. An electrical response
measurement can avoid microphone bias for amplifier correction, but its
speaker load, input path and tone settings must match the intended use.

Use **Import measured profile** to load a JSON file containing correction
filters derived from a published electrical measurement. The preview shows
the claimed source and conditions before applying it. The app validates file
size and numeric limits; it does not authenticate the source or measurement.
Imported profiles are stored locally. No network access or microphone recording
is needed to apply them.

Profile schema (illustrative values only; not a measured model):

```json
{
  "schema": 1,
  "model": "Exact amplifier model and revision",
  "measurementSource": "https://publisher.example/exact-measurement",
  "conditions": "8-ohm resistive load; RCA input; tone controls centered; 1 W",
  "filters": [
    {"type": "HS", "frequency": 8000, "gain": -1.0, "q": 0.707}
  ]
}
```

Use 1–16 `PK` (peaking), `LS` (low shelf), or `HS` (high shelf) filters,
frequencies from 20–20000 Hz, gain within ±6 dB, and Q from 0.1–6.
Files must be smaller than 64 KiB; at most 32 imported profiles are retained.
Gain is a **correction**, not the measured response itself. This EQ addresses
frequency response; it cannot remove amplifier noise, clipping or distortion.

## Use

- The **Equalizer** tab opens first, with the frequency sliders and response
  graph at the top, followed by listening presets, post gain, balance and meters.
  **Settings & calibration** contains device selection, speaker and amplifier
  profiles, microphone controls, and sweep settings. Each page scrolls as needed.
- **Automatic** starts with the current default output. When a new output is
  connected, it switches to that device. If it disappears, it falls back to an
  available output. Choose a named device to keep the EQ on that device.
- Set **Bands** anywhere from 5 to 31. The current EQ shape is interpolated
  when the count changes, so your tuning is retained. The default is 15 bands.
- Move a slider or drag a point on the curve to adjust gain. Select a band and
  edit its center frequency, gain, or Q in the fields above the curve. Keyboard
  navigation works on the sliders and fields. Changes apply immediately without
  restarting the filter. Post gain and balance update immediately too.
- Boosts automatically lower the preamp using the calculated combined response
  to leave headroom. If playback is too quiet, move **Post gain** right in 0.5 dB
  steps. It acts after the EQ and is saved for the next launch. The default is
  0 dB; raising it can clip loud source material.
- Pick a built-in preset or save your own. Custom presets live in your user
  configuration directory. Saved nine-band presets from earlier releases can
  still be loaded.
- Use **Lock EQ** to protect playback presets, bands, post gain, and balance
  from accidental edits. The lock is remembered when the app restarts. **Undo**
  or Ctrl+Z restores the previous playback setting; repeated changes while
  dragging one control count as one step. The last 50 steps are available while
  the app is open. Rolling the mouse wheel over EQ sliders or number fields
  scrolls the window toward the level indicators instead of changing sound.
- The scrollable preset list includes Deep Bass, Podcast, TV Dialogue,
  FPS Footsteps, Rock, Jazz, Electronic, Hip-Hop, Night Listening, Loudness, and more.
  Separators divide the list; every named entry is a working preset.
- **Loudness** applies a fixed bass and treble contour for quiet listening, like
  the loudness controls on older receivers. It does not change with the volume.
- Colored bars beside the band sliders show estimated post-EQ levels from a
  live, local spectrum sample. A 4096-point FFT uses overlapping audio windows
  and checks for new audio at the chosen refresh interval while the window is
  open. Teal means ordinary activity, amber approaches
  full scale, and red suggests clipping risk. The peak text uses the same
  colors. These are estimates based on the EQ input and current settings; they
  do not measure the DAC or guarantee that every transient is caught.
- Closing the window keeps the equalizer running. Use its indicator icon to
  reopen it or turn processing on or off. **Quit app** unloads it and restores
  normal output. Launching the app again reopens the existing window. If the
  desktop has no tray, closing the window exits and restores normal output.
- Click the framed **Equalizer on/off** control to compare the processed sound
  with the normal output.

### Microphone

The **Microphone** section selects a connected input automatically, including
USB webcams with microphones. Its **Natural mic EQ** switch starts on when an
input is present. You can pin a specific input from the dropdown or turn the
mic EQ off without changing the playback EQ. A gentle 80 Hz high pass filter
reduces rumble; warmth, boxiness, clarity, and air have modest starting values.
Each slider adds or removes up to 12 dB from that starting value, in 0.5 dB
steps. **Mic gain** also ranges from -12 to +12 dB. Changes take effect while
the mic is in use, and **Reset mic tone** returns to the starting profile.

The starting profile is a voice-oriented suggestion, not an automatic acoustic
measurement of your microphone or room. Listen to a recording or call test and
adjust the controls for your mic. The app handles mono and stereo capture; a
mono webcam cannot provide left/right position information for room-following
balance. On current WirePlumber systems, the microphone filter is transparent
to recording apps. Older systems use a virtual default microphone while the
filter is active and restore the prior input when it stops.
The status line reports when the selected microphone disconnects. If only an
onboard input remains, it also says that no USB microphone is detected.

### Speaker and room check

Place the microphone near your usual listening position and use **Measure** in
the Microphone section. The default test starts with a short 20 Hz hold, then
sweeps logarithmically from 20 Hz to 25 kHz over ten seconds. It analyzes 20,
40, 63, 125, 250, 500, 1000, 2000, 4000, 8000, 16000, and 20000 Hz. You
can choose separate tones instead. Both test signals fade in and out. The test
level starts at -24 dBFS and can be adjusted from -54 to -5 dBFS. Start at a
comfortable level and use **Stop tones** if needed. The microphone filter
pauses during the check and resumes afterward.

The app samples room noise before playback and ignores frequencies it cannot
hear clearly above that noise. A quiet room gives a more useful result; pause
other audio while measuring. The preview shows each measured frequency and
limits its suggested change to 3 dB. **Apply suggested EQ** makes the changes
immediately; **Keep current EQ** discards them. Use **Save preset** to retain
an applied result. The measurement includes the combined response of the
speaker, amplifier, room, and microphone. It cannot separate the microphone's
own frequency response, so listen and adjust the result to taste. The generated
signal and capture stream use 96 kHz, but hardware running at 48 kHz may filter
out the end of the sweep near 25 kHz. The EQ itself has no 25 kHz band, and the
app makes no adjustment above its 20 kHz limit. Very low or high frequencies
may also be unmeasurable with a small speaker or webcam microphone; the app
leaves those frequencies unchanged.

**Hardware note:** An equalizer changes the audio signal. It will not repair a
physical output that pops when its amplifier powers up. Select a different
output in the dropdown if one device has that behavior.

## Build from source

```bash
sudo apt install cmake ninja-build g++ qt6-base-dev pipewire pipewire-bin pipewire-pulse wireplumber pulseaudio-utils
cmake -S . -B build -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build
./build/soundcurrent-eq
```

Build an installable package:

```bash
./scripts/build-deb.sh
```

The Ubuntu package and checksum appear in `dist/`. To build an RPM on Fedora or
RHEL, install `cmake`, `gcc-c++`, `qt6-qtbase-devel`, `rpm-build`, `tar`, and
`gzip`, then run `./scripts/build-rpm.sh`. RPM files and checksums appear in
`dist/x86_64/`. The GitHub release workflow builds Ubuntu, Fedora 44, RHEL 10
compatible, and Windows x64 packages for each `v*` tag.

## Verify the interface and audio routing

```bash
./build/soundcurrent-eq --self-test
QT_QPA_PLATFORM=offscreen ./build/soundcurrent-eq --ui-self-test
python3 tests/audio_response.py ./build/soundcurrent-eq
./build/soundcurrent-eq --mic-self-test
```

The first command briefly creates the EQ sink, changes its band count and
controls, and checks that the original default output and volume are restored.
It uses the
currently selected physical output and does not play a test sound. The second
checks the 31-band interface, preset library, lock and Undo, wheel scrolling,
selected-band controls, window fit, and calibration analysis without using audio.
The third command sends tones through a temporary silent sink and verifies
that a 12 dB band cut changes the measured output by about 12 dB and that
Night Listening reduces low-frequency output, Loudness emphasizes bass over
midrange, and +6 dB output gain raises the measured output by about 6 dB.
It requires `paplay` and `parec`, and leaves the normal default output alone.
The microphone check uses the selected input without saving audio and verifies
that its filter connects and accepts live changes. It restores the prior input.

## Privacy and safety

The app has no account, network service, or telemetry. It runs without root and
keeps temporary audio configuration in a private directory. The level display
reads the local EQ sink and does not save audio. The microphone filter processes
capture audio locally and does not record it to disk. Speaker measurement holds
microphone samples in memory; the generated sweep or tones are temporary files
deleted after the test. The `.deb` installs the binary,
launcher, icon, and license files. See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for
vulnerability reporting.

## How it works

On Linux, the filter uses PipeWire's [filter-chain module](https://docs.pipewire.org/page_module_filter_chain.html)
with built-in biquad filters. Device routing is controlled through PipeWire's
PulseAudio compatibility tools. On Windows, WASAPI shared-mode capture and
render streams use VB-CABLE to connect the system output to the selected
physical playback device.
